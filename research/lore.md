# Forgotten Ruin MUD Lore

This document outlines the core lore elements from the "Forgotten Ruin" book series, which can be used to build the MUD.

## Places

*   **The World of Ruin:** A future Earth, 10,000 years after a nano-plague collapsed modern civilization. Magic is real, and mutated humans have become fantasy races.
*   **Area 51 (Past):** The origin point of the Rangers' journey. Could be a starting zone or a special event area.
*   **The Land of Black Sleep:** A kingdom ruled by a medusa queen, home to the Lich Pharaoh's legions. A high-level, dangerous zone.
*   **Eastern Lands:** From where werewolves and vampires originate. A potential zone with a gothic horror theme.
*   **Dragon's Lair:** The home of an ancient dragon allied with the dark forces. A likely raid or boss encounter area.
*   **Ranger Outposts:** Fortified locations built by the stranded Rangers. These could serve as safe zones or quest hubs.
*   **Orcish Camps:** Numerous and savage, these could be procedurally generated or placed throughout the world for players to fight through.

## Themes

*   **Military Sci-Fi meets High Fantasy:** The core theme. Modern tactics and technology against magic and mythical creatures.
*   **Survival:** The Rangers, and by extension the players, are outnumbered and out of their element. Scavenging, crafting, and strategic thinking are key.
*   **Hope in a Ruined World:** Despite the grim setting, the Rangers' refusal to surrender provides a spark of hope.
*   **The Clash of Cultures:** The interaction between the modern-day soldiers and the inhabitants of the future world.

## Characters

### Player-Controlled Ranger Squad

Each player controls a full 9-person Ranger squad, modeled on modern US Army Ranger rifle squad composition. The squad is divided into a Squad HQ element and two 4-person fire teams (Alpha and Bravo).

**Squad Composition:**

*   **Squad Leader (Staff Sergeant):** The player's primary character. Wields an M4A1 Carbine.
    *   *Leads the entire squad and provides commands to the fire teams.*

*   **Alpha Team:**
    *   **Team Leader (Sergeant):** Wields an M4A1 Carbine.
    *   **Automatic Rifleman (Specialist):** Wields an M249 LMG.
    *   **Grenadier (Specialist):** Wields an M4A1 with an M320 Grenade Launcher.
    *   **Rifleman (Private First Class):** Wields an M4A1 Carbine.

*   **Bravo Team:**
    *   **Team Leader (Sergeant):** Wields an M4A1 Carbine.
    *   **Automatic Rifleman (Specialist):** Wields an M249 LMG.
    *   **Grenadier (Specialist):** Wields an M4A1 with an M320 Grenade Launcher.
    *   **Rifleman (Private First Class):** Wields an M4A1 Carbine.

**Secondary Duties:**

In addition to their primary role, squad members can be assigned secondary duties. These skills can be improved through use.

*   **Medic:** One squad member per fire team should be designated as the medic. They are responsible for treating injuries.
*   **Engineer:** One squad member can be designated as the engineer, responsible for repairing equipment, building fortifications, and handling demolitions.
*   **Talker:** One squad member can be the designated "Talker," responsible for any linguistic challenges and negotiations. This would be a good role for the Squad Leader or a Team Leader.

*   **Friendly Locals:** Maybe some of the mutated humans are not hostile and could be playable races or allied NPCs that can be recruited into the squad.

### Antagonists

*   **The Dark Army:** The main enemy faction, composed of:
    *   **Orcs:** Savage and numerous.
    *   **Trolls:** Large, brutish monsters.
    *   **Wraith Riders:** Fast, ghostly cavalry.
    *   **Dark Wizards:** Magic-users of the enemy.
*   **The Lich Pharaoh:** A powerful undead ruler. A potential main antagonist.
*   **The Medusa Queen:** Ruler of the Land of Black Sleep.
*   **Werewolves and Vampires:** From the east, adding a gothic horror element.
*   **The Ancient Dragon:** A powerful, intelligent foe.

## Mechanics

*   **Hybrid Combat System:** Combining modern ranged combat (firearms) with traditional fantasy melee and magic.
*   **Skill-Based Progression:** Instead of just levels, players could improve their skills through use, reflecting the Rangers' adaptation to the new world.
*   **Crafting:** Players could scavenge old-world technology and combine it with new-world materials to create unique gear.
*   **Squad-Based Gameplay:** Encourage players to team up and use real-world military tactics to overcome challenges.
*   **Dynamic World Events:** The Dark Army could launch assaults on Ranger outposts, requiring players to defend them.
*   **Language System:** The "Talker" class suggests a language barrier, which could be a game mechanic. Players might need to learn languages to interact with certain NPCs.
