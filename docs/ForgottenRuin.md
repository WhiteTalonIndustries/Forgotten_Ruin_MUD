INTRODUCTION
All enemy elements are currently heading straight for our position 
from several points on the compass. It would be naive in the extreme to think 
they are not going to hit us in the next twelve hours and hit us hard with everything 
they’ve got. The enemy force is numbered at upwards of five thousand. 
We are two hundred rangers and special personnel plus 
a highly trained flight crew and three civilians.
– Forgotten Ruin
Welcome to Forgotten Ruin: The 
Adventure Wargame, an exciting 
adventure pitting heavy firepower against 
the monsters and magic of a fantasy 
world� Of course, things get complicated 
when the person manning the machine 
gun is also a were-tiger� 
Within this book, you will find everything 
needed to play from a rules perspective� 
Simply add whatever miniatures you 
like, and you are ready to adventure� I 
suggest reading this chapter carefully 
as it outlines some basic principles that 
underpin the game� 
Adventure Wargaming
Traditionally, a wargame is a military 
affair between armies of troops facing 
each other in a pitched battle� Both forces 
are usually picked from an army list 
and, once you are done playing, they go 
back in the box (or on the shelf) and the 
next time you play is unconnected from 
the last� At Nordic Weasel Games and 
Modiphius Entertainment, we use the 
term ‘adventure wargaming’ to describe 
a very different beast� 
First, it is player-friendly: You can pick 
whatever figures you would like to use; 
you can play on a compact gaming space 
(3x3 feet is recommended), and the game 
is played in a modest amount of time 
rather than demanding an entire day to 
get through�
It is oriented towards solo gaming, 
allowing you to play on your own time, 
though inviting a friend for cooperative 
play is easy as well�

More importantly, the game is played as 
an open-ended campaign� Your rangers 
have Objectives to achieve, both in the 
big picture and on a mission-by-mission 
basis, but the cost of those Objectives may 
turn out to be too steep� 
You will create your own smaller goals, 
such as gaining more experience for 
a particular character or making it 
through this mission so you can get some 
replacements� 
As you play, the games will link together 
to create an overarching story where 
seemingly random events start to 
connect� This is even more effective 
because your characters are carried over 
from one battle to the next� Instead of a 
faceless army, that sergeant is the one 
that took down a troll the other day, 
saving the rest of the squad from being 
wiped out� Or the guy who can’t shoot 
straight� Or the lieutenant who never 
gets hit� 
An adventure wargame is not strictly 
balanced� In Forgotten Ruin: The 
Adventure Wargame, as with the 
original books series, there is no points 
system in sight� While the game strives 
for a degree of balance to make things 
fun, you are governed by more realistic 
concerns: You only have so many troops 
to deploy and if you take too many losses 
now, you will be short later�
The enemy may show up with only a  
few scouts or they may launch an all-out 
assault� Some battles will be brutally

difficult, others will be merely target 
practice for your squad� 
Part of the excitement is rolling with these 
punches and making the most of them�  
Do you battle it out to the last soldier or 
do you conduct a fighting retreat? 
I think you will find it an exciting ride� 
Solo Gaming
Forgotten Ruin: The Adventure Wargame 
is written to be played as a solo game� 
The game system includes instructions 
for how the enemy will move and attack 
as well as how to resolve each step of 
the campaign turn� The aim is for the 
experience to be as “out of the box” as 
possible, meaning if you follow the steps 
provided in the game rules you will not 
have to create anything else� However,  
the game is very amenable to creating  
fun, interesting characters, enemies,  
and moments�
The rules can be enjoyed in cooperative 
play as well by splitting up the available 
soldiers between the players� For 
example, each player takes one fire team, 
with one player also taking the squad 
leader, or a third player runs the squad 
leader and any additional figures� This 
lets you play together and face off against 
the evil monsters as a team� If you find 
this option is a bit easier than playing 
alone, you can always use the difficulty 
adjustments provided in the rules to tailor 
your experience� 
Other options for playing together include 
having one player take control of the 
villains (you can take turns doing this) or 
even having a Game Master create special 
scenarios� These are all fantastic ways in 
which to explore the world of Forgotten 
Ruin in miniature�
A 5X Experience
Forgotten Ruin: The Adventure Wargame 
is part of a series of game rules 
collectively known as “Five X” or “5X”� 
These are solo-oriented campaign games 
played with miniatures, and consist of 
Five Parsecs from Home, Five Leagues 
from the Borderlands, and other titles� 
The game rules are similar enough 
that you should have little difficulty in 
picking up the game quickly if you are 
an old hand, however read the new rules 
carefully: A lot of things work slightly 
differently to accommodate the style of 
combat and adventure of the Forgotten 
Ruin setting� 
Connection to the Book 
Series
The game is based principally on the first 
novel in the “Forgotten Ruin” series by 
Jason Anspach and Nick Cole� A force of 
US Army Rangers are sent on a mission 
to the future to save humanity but find 
themselves embroiled in a brutal war 
against a foe that seems to be straight out 
of a classic fantasy adventure story� 
Soon, modern firepower and military 
tactics will have to contend with an 
onslaught of orcs and monsters, and 
the rangers will need all their courage, 
creativity, and firepower to survive�
This game can be thought of as an 
alternate story, taking place side by side 
with the book series, following a platoon 
with a set of original characters (yours!) 
that must survive in this world�
The appendices include designer notes on 
the adaptation�

Alternate Squads and 
Settings
While the original stories featured US 
Rangers, you may want to do a different 
unit or even nationality, whether you 
served in one or just really like the look� 
You might even want to try playing the 
game with a WW2 Rangers squad or a 
handful of science fiction figures you have 
sitting around (after all, the original story 
also featured science fiction elements, so 
almost anything is viable)�
The rules are agnostic regarding the 
specific miniatures you choose, so you 
can substitute the correct weapons and 
use a bit of best judgement� For example, 
for a second world war squad, the assault 
rifles are instead M1 rifles, the anti-tank 
weapon is a bazooka, and so forth� We 
recommend not trying to adjust the 
weapon profiles to make the weapons 
stronger or weaker unless you really feel 
you have to� 
The important part is to have fun with 
your campaign and selecting the figures 
you are really happy to use is a big part 
of that�
Social Solo
Solo gaming does not have to be a lonely 
experience� 
Over the last few years, a phenomenon 
has sprung up that we have dubbed 
“social solo” gaming� Essentially, this is 
playing games solo but discussing them 
online with other gamers� Solo gamers 
are sharing photos of their gaming tables, 
writing up or blogging reports of their 
games, sharing the stories they create, and 
showing off the miniatures they paint up 
for each battle�
It is a fantastic way to stay in touch while 
still being able to play games on your 
own terms and schedule� Whether it is on 
social media, gaming forums, or blogs, 
there is a wealth of options out there 
to check out, and it can be incredibly 
inspiring to see what other gamers are 
up to�

Introduction
THE ADVENTURE AHEAD OF YOU
The orcs were frightening, hairy beasts bristling with fangs, claws, 
leather armor wrapped in dark rags, and literally wicked-looking scimitars 
they tried to slash us with. But swords as deadly as they appeared, 
couldn't shoot back at us. They didn't have AK-47s or PKMs.
– Forgotten Ruin
The world was collapsing. A mysterious 
ailment was enveloping reality, 
turning people into monsters and 
causing technology to fail. They said 
it was a nano-plague and that it was 
doubtful we would survive it. Not you 
or me, all of us. Mankind as a whole.  
A secret military project was assembled 
to send an expedition into the near 
future, after the nano-plague had 
subsided, to help rebuild. 
Something went amiss. Maybe the 
Quantum Singularity Tachyon gate was 
not configured correctly. Maybe it was 
tampered with. Maybe someone just 
pushed the wrong button. Maybe you 
were flung far into the voids of time. 
Whatever the reason, your expeditionary 
force finds itself stuck in a savage world 
filled with creatures straight out of 
mythology and fantasy literature.
Your platoon finds itself on its own. 
Isolated from your comrades, all you 
have is each other. Somewhere out there 
are your friends: If you can find them, 
maybe you can also find some answers. 
Until then, its business as usual.
Does the field manual say anything 
about the correct procedure for firing a 
rocket launcher at a troll?

BASIC PRINCIPLES
This chapter explains core ideas of how 
we do things in “5X” games, as well as 
giving you the basics if you are new 
to tabletop gaming� You might want 
to give this a look even if you are a 
seasoned veteran�
Basic Structure
The game is a solo experience, meaning 
you as the player control your forces 
against opposition controlled by the “AI” 
through game mechanics� Consequently, 
the game is self-paced, allowing you to 
progress faster or slower as you see fit, 
and suited to your schedule and desired 
degree of challenge�
As you play, your squad will gain 
experience as well as magical abilities, 
you will find loot, and you will face off 
against more and more dangerous foes  
in tabletop battles with your  
miniature figures�
The campaign has victory conditions 
built in, though you may prefer playing 
a shorter campaign� If so, start out by 
playing a set number of campaign turns 
or until you have claimed a particular 
number of map areas�
Time Keeping
We use three measures of time in the 
game:
  The first is the campaign turn (or 
simply ‘turn’)� Each turn has a single 
tabletop battle and can represent 
anything from a few days to a week 
or two�
  The second is the battle round (or 
‘round’)� This is used only in tabletop 
battle and is enough time for every 
figure on the table to do something� 
It might be a few seconds up to a few 
minutes depending on what is going 
on at the time�
  Finally, we have the mission�  
A mission is one tabletop battle 
from start to finish� There is always a 
mission every campaign turn�
Components of a Mission
The tactical parts of the game, played 
with your miniature figures, consists 
of missions, each of which is a single 
encounter with the enemy� During each 
mission, you will have Objectives to 
accomplish to defeat the enemy and gain 
victory� These are randomly generated and 
may include tasks like fetching important 
things off the battlefield or pushing 
through the enemy lines�
The battlefield will also have 
Investigations: These are points of 
interest that may reward you – or unveil 
further dangers – as you explore them� 
Both Investigations and Objectives 
should be marked by placing a suitable 
token on the table�

Common Sense AI
The game relies on the player injecting 
a certain degree of common sense into 
proceedings� The AI rules for how the 
enemy moves and fights makes them 
fairly predictable, in order to make the 
game play quickly, but they are still 
meant to represent sentient beings� 
As such when moving and placing the 
enemies, you should be bearing this 
in mind� If moving directly towards a 
soldier would put an orc in the open 
but moving 1" to the left they would be 
in Cover, they should be placed in the 
position that offers Cover for example�
This is ultimately a personal decision, and 
you may of course have more fun if the 
enemy is dumber than expected or more 
cunning than expected� Some players 
prefer to ignore the AI mechanics and just 
do whatever seems like the best move for 
the enemy every turn� 
You may even have another player control 
the AI with the cunning plans (or lack 
thereof) that can entail�
Resolving Rules Questions
This is a big game with a lot of moving 
parts and it is easy to get a little 
overwhelmed at first� If you are not sure 
how something is supposed to work, 
take a moment to read the rules section 
again� In most cases if you apply the rules 
literally, you will get an answer� 
If this doesn’t help, try to envision what 
either makes the most sense (within the 
magical realism of the game world) or 
seems to be the intended way for things 
to work�
If all else fails, you are welcome to email 
the author or you might prefer to make a 
ruling on the spot�
May and Must
The rules are written intentionally: If the 
game says you may do something, you 
may also choose not to� If the rules say you 
will or must do something, you cannot 
choose not to�
We often say that a character is rolling 
something or doing something� As our 
little toy soldiers are not actually sapient 
(or so they like us to think) this is of 
course just colorful language to avoid 
saying “the player then rolls” all the time�
I Made a Mistake!
You just started a new round when you 
realize you forgot a monster ability last 
round� Don’t worry� In a big campaign 
game, it is inevitable that you slip up 
somewhere� Maybe you forgot to add a 
bonus, or you missed an enemy ability 
during the last battle�
Whatever the case is, always move 
forward� 
It is rarely worth going back and trying 
to redo a bunch of things that already 
happened� In most cases, small mistakes 
won’t seriously affect your campaign as 
things tend to even out over time� Make 
a note going forward and keep moving 
on� If you received an advantage you 
shouldn’t, add a few extra bad guys to the 
next battle� 
If it is something big, then make a few on-
the-spot adjustments to get things back 
on track� Maybe you awarded way too 
much XP, so skip XP next battle, or maybe 
you should have faced more enemies last 
time, so add them this time�
Whatever the situation, avoid going back 
and trying to undo events, especially if 
they happened several campaign turns or 
battle rounds ago� Make a correction (if it 
is truly needed) and move on�

Weird Situations
In a procedurally generated game, it is 
inevitable that strange things happen� It 
is up to the player to decide what happens 
then� In most cases the game will be more 
fun if you take a moment to think about 
how the result can be interpreted� For 
example, a golem probably cannot roar 
to call more of its golem friends to battle, 
but maybe the golems are all fitted with 
magical alarms that lets them converge 
on a foe� 
If a particular specific result bothers you, 
you can change it to a different outcome 
that fits better or modify the rule slightly 
so that it works for you� For example, if 
you roll a spider villain that can cast the 
Hellfire spell you might change that to a 
different outcome from the same table if 
you feel that fits better�
You may prefer to just embrace the 
strangeness and chalk it up to a magical 
world: Of course, an evil spider 
can cast spells, and of course 
golems emit a fierce war cry 
when they go into battle!
Key 'rule of thumb’: In general, 
special cases supersede regular cases� 
If an item or ability modifies 
how a core rule works, the item or 
ability takes precedent�
Soldiers, Enemies, and More
A figure on the table is generally referred 
to as a “character” when we mean 
the entity in the game world, and a 
“figure” when we specifically refer to the 
miniature itself on the table�
The term “soldier” always means one of 
the figures commanded by the player, 
while “enemy” always means one of the 
bad guys you are fighting against� These 
are controlled by the game system�
We use the term “opponent” to mean a 
character that is hostile to the character 
in question� In other words, the enemy 
are your opponents while you are the 
opponents of the enemy� 
When two characters are fighting each 
other hand-to-hand, we refer to them 
as “combatants”� A character is only a 
combatant while that fight lasts�
If this all seems a little abstract, don’t 
worry� You will get the hang of it quickly 
and it avoids confusing phrases like “the 
enemy then targets 
the nearest enemy”� 
Most enemies 
attack in groups we 
refer to in the game 
as “mobs”� The 
members of a mob 
move and fight 
as a cohesive 
entity�
Some particularly 
mean enemies are called 
“villains”� These are more 
powerful and feature 
special abilities�

Miniatures Handling
When figures are moved, they should 
always be placed in a way that allows the 
figure to stand comfortably� If a position is 
a little precarious, such as on the edge of a 
terrain feature, you may want to move the 
figure back a little bit and then just put a 
marker on the true location to avoid the 
figure falling over and being damaged�
Figures are said to be “in contact” when 
the bases are touching (also known 
as “base contact”)� This is particularly 
relevant for hand-to-hand combat� As 
some figures have very dramatic poses, 
it can sometimes be difficult to get them 
to line up correctly� If the attacking figure 
has sufficient movement to reach base 
contact, hand-to-hand combat can be 
engaged in even if the figures cannot 
physically be positioned correctly due to 
the pose of either figure� 
Measurements
All measurements in the game are 
given in inches as this is an established 
convention in miniature gaming� Players 
who prefer metric measurements may 
opt to multiply all distances by 2�5 to get 
centimeters� 
When measuring distances between 
figures measure to and from the closest 
point of the base, never from any point on 
the figure itself� 
The exception may be if you have an 
unusual figure that is placed on a much 
larger base than it occupies� If so, you may 
prefer measuring to and from the body of 
the figure instead of the edge of the base�
The player can always measure before 
deciding where to move or shoot, and can 
check distances at any time� 
Measure base to base

Dice Basics
During combat, dice rolls are generally 
six-sided dice (D6)� Typically, you are 
trying to roll equal or above a particular 
target number� For example, if the rules 
say you have to roll 5+, then a roll of 
a 5 or a 6 is a success� Often, multiple 
dice are rolled at the same and each 
compared to the target number, for 
example for rapid-fire weapons that get 
multiple attacks per turn�
If the rules say to roll 2D6, 3D6, etc�, 
roll that number of dice and add them 
together� For example, a 2D6 roll of 2 and 
6 is a total score of 8�
The campaign rules make use of D100 
rolls� This is done by a rolling a pair of 
ten-sided dice (D10) and reading the first 
die as the tens and the second die as the 
ones� For example, a roll of 3 and 8 is a 
score of 38� Likewise,
A 0 and 7 would be a 7� 
A 7 and 0 would be a 70�
A 0 and 0 is read as 100 (although often 
still noted on random tables as 00).
You can get special “percentile” dice to 
use, but the author has always opted for 
using the darker colored die as the tens 
and the lighter as the ones�
Modifiers
Rolls are often modified by bonuses 
or game circumstances� Simply add all 
applicable modifiers to the die roll� For 
example, a roll of a 3 with a +2 modifier 
is a final score of a 5� Modifiers cannot 
reduce a roll below a 0�  
Note that modifiers can make a roll 
succeed automatically or make a roll 
impossible� Unlike some games you may 
be familiar with, there is no “6 always 
succeeds, 1 always fails” rule�
The rules may state that something 
happens on a natural roll of a specific 
number� This means the dice must show 
that number before modifiers are applied� 
A roll of a 1 with a +2 modifier is both a 
natural 1 and a score of 3, while a 4 with 
a +2 modifier is a score of 6 but is not a 
natural 6� 
If the game allows you to reroll a die, 
pick it up and roll it again� The original 
score is ignored for all purposes, and 
you must use the new score unless the 
game specifically says you can pick 
either outcome�
A reroll on a D100 roll means both dice 
are rerolled�

Introduction
Random Selection
If you need to randomly determine a 
result from a number of options (and if 
there isn’t a table covering the options 
already), number them sequentially from 
one and up, then roll any appropriate 
die and count from the left rerolling any 
“missing” numbers� For example, to pick 
from five terrain features, roll a D6 and 
reroll if you get a 6�
Random Directions
If something has to move in a random 
direction or a random direction has to 
be determined, roll a ten-sided dice: The 
raised tip indicates the direction� You can 
also purchase special “direction dice” if 
you prefer a little bit of custom kit�
Random directions can be fiddly on a 
dense table so a little interpretation 
may be required� You can avoid 
some of the difficulties 
by making sure to roll 
as close to the point of 
origin as possible�
Trackable Resources
As you play, your squad will accumulate 
several different resources, including:
Story Points: These help you tweak the 
game world a little in your favor, as well as 
guide the story� See page 23�
Victory Points: A method of tallying your 
campaign success See pages 67-68�
Luck: Luck allows a figure to avoid 
casualties or situations that might be 
detrimental to them� See page 45�
Support Points: Spend these during battle 
to gain fire, tactical, sniper, and other 
forms of support in battle� See page 77�
Kit Points: Spend these at the end of a 
mission to add weapons, armor, medical 
supplies and more to squad� See page 122�
Aggression: Your enemy’s increasing 
Aggression score tracks when they deploy 
a new scheme against you� See page 34�
Exposure: Absorbed into this new world, 
your squad will experience changes and 
develop fantastical abilities� See page 121�

SQUAD CREATION
To play the campaign, you will need a 
squad� These are the soldiers that you 
will rely upon in battle� Simply follow the 
steps in this chapter one by one, and by 
the end you will have everything you need 
to begin playing� 
To get started, print out a copy of the 
platoon sheet (see page 158)�
The Squad
The squad is the core of the game and 
consists of nine soldiers that you follow 
as you adventure in the game world�
The squad is organized into:
  2x fire teams, each of which has 
 1x fire team leader and 
 3x soldiers
  plus a squad leader�
Go ahead and name everybody at this 
stage, and note them on your platoon 
sheet, with the fire team leader the first 
soldier in each fire team�
During missions, your fire teams can set 
up as you see fit and are not required 
to move or fight together (being highly 
trained elite soldiers)� You may find that 
keeping fire teams together in the battle 
makes a lot of sense, however� 
Players should note that if you are basing 
your squad on a famous military unit, you 
can adjust the squad size to fit the correct 
size for that unit, or just use nine soldiers 
regardless, since this is what the game 
is balanced around� Players preferring 
a more challenging experience might 
use a smaller squad size to increase the 
difficulty of the campaign� 
Name Generation
Over the course of a campaign, you will 
require a lot of names� While you can 
make up your own, many people find it 
helpful to use an online name generator 
or a list of baby names� You can always 
generate 10 at a time and then pick the 
best ones�

The Platoon
Your squad is part of a larger force 
called a platoon� In most armies, a 
platoon consists of 3 squads as well 
as a commander and possibly some 
additional weapons� You will not have to 
generate details for all of those troops, 
however� The rest of the platoon exists in 
the background and will furnish you with 
more soldiers here and there� 
The following pages will explain how 
your forces work, and take you through 
the process of creating your characters 
and filling out your platoon roster� 
First, detail the platoon leader and the 
platoon senior sergeant, giving each of 
them a name� These two individuals may 
accompany you on missions, but are not 
normally part of your squad�
The Platoon Leader
Typically a lieutenant, this is the 
person in charge of the whole 
platoon� They are picked for their 
leadership ability and tactical 
perspective� They are a Leader in 
the game rules, granting you 
an additional Initiative die at 
the start of each battle round 
when they are accompanying 
you into battle (see page 78 
for more)� 
The Platoon Sergeant
Also called the platoon NCO 
(Non-Commissioned 
Officer), this is a senior 
sergeant who helps 
run the platoon, and 
is often a seasoned 
veteran with plenty of 
experience� When 
they accompany 
you into battle, they 
grant you an additional use of 
Leadership Tactics (see page 48)�
Types of Soldiers
We divide unit soldiers into two types: 
Grunts and known personalities 
(explained further on page 20)� For most 
game purposes they are all soldiers and 
move and fight in a similar manner� The 
difference is that grunts are just that: 
Soldiers� They have the standard profile 
for a starting character and no special 
quirks, though they may be a Leader�
We recommend that you name the  
grunts in your squad� 
The known personalities are those we 
know a little bit more about� Think 
of them as the main characters in a 
television show where you see lots of 
people pass by and some of them you 
know by name, but there are certain 
people you know a lot more about: These 
known personalities receive additional 
attention when you create your squad, 
and they are eligible to advance 
through battle experience� 
Using your Veteran Roster
If you have completed a prior 
campaign, you will have a sheet  
of previous soldiers known as  
the veteran roster� You may 
select up to two soldiers from 
that sheet when you set up 
a new campaign� They are 
carried over with their old 
profile, transformations, 
and so forth� 
Note that the soldiers 
selected do not need to 
have been from the same 
squad originally and they 
do not have to be assigned 
to the same position or 
weapons that they  
originally held�

## Page 21

SQUAD CREATION

How Ranks Work
We do not worry too much about the 
specific ranks in question� Typically, a 
platoon leader is a lieutenant while a 
squad leader is a sergeant; however, this 
can vary across armies and branches 
of service� Additionally, during combat 
operations, it is not unusual for someone 
to end up filling out a position that 
normally would be run by someone of a 
different rank� For this reason, we tend to 
use the position and not the actual rank�
In case you need to know who has the 
higher rank, the following list applies 
from highest to lowest:
 Platoon leader ->
  Platoon sergeant ->
   Any squad leader ->
    Any fire team leader ->
     Any other soldier
However, feel free to identify individual 
characters as you see fit� If your backstory 
means your ‘platoon sergeant’ likes to be 
addressed as 'Major’, and your platoon 
leader’s a colonel who wandered the 
wrong side of a dimensional rift, so be it!
Starting Profile
Each of your soldiers has a basic profile 
depending on their position�
The numbers on the profile are used to 
measure various functions in the game� 
Think of them as a numeric estimate of 
how tough, strong, fast, and trained a 
soldier is� These values can change as you 
play the campaign game�
Reactions: This measures the ability of 
your soldiers to respond quickly and to 
preempt enemy actions� 
Speed: The distance a soldier can move on 
the gaming table each turn�
Combat Skill: This is added to all combat 
dice rolls�
Toughness: If a soldier gets hit in combat, 
the enemy is trying to roll equal or above 
this number to hurt you�
Wits: This is added to certain dice 
rolls such as achieving Objectives and 
performing non-combat tasks�
Position Reactions Speed Combat Skill Toughness Wits
Soldier 2 5" +0 3 +0
Fire team leader 3 5" +0 3 +1

Known Personalities
You begin the game with 3 known 
personalities: One will be your squad 
leader, one will be a fire team leader and 
one will be a regular soldier (from either 
fire team)� Everyone else begins as a grunt� 
Each personality receives two character 
traits generated by rolling D100 on the 
Character Traits table below� If you roll 
the same trait twice, they only receive that 
single trait, but also receive a roll on the 
Knacks table�

D100 Knack Effects
01-25 Crafty The character may take their action before moving, if desired� 
If the selected action or weapons attack would limit movement, 
these limits must still be adhered to�
26-50 Healthy If the character is injured and must miss battles, reduce the 
recovery time by 1 turn�
51-75 Determined Once per battle before the soldier would roll a D6 to accomplish 
a non-combat task, you may roll twice and pick the best score�
76-00 Flexible Once per battle you may either move twice but not take an 
action or take two actions but not move� 
Character Traits in Play
Once per battle round, when a character 
performs an action that would fit within a 
character trait of themselves or a soldier 
within 6" and Line of Sight, you may opt 
to modify the result of a single die up or 
down 1 point after rolling the die� Only a 
single die can be modified in this fashion 
(even if multiple dice were rolled) and 
only once per battle round� 
The situation must fit under the 
character trait, though it is up to you to 
interpret this� You may wish to treat this 
mostly as a roleplaying exercise or you 
may opt to be stringent� 
Traits can be used out of combat as well, 
in which case a character that is sent off 
on their own cannot rely on the traits of 
anyone else�

You may generate a minor aspect for 
each known personality� These do not

Pivotal Events
Dramatic events can result in a person 
changing as a response� You are welcome 
to add, change, or reroll a character’s 
personality aspect any time you feel it 
would suit the story� When doing this, it 
often works best to roll twice and pick the 
result that you feel fits events the most�

Your Main Character
Select one of the three known personalities 
to be your main character� This character, 
more than anyone else, represents you in 
the game� You could even name them your 
own name, but it is usually better to come 
up with something different, just in case 
your hero dies horribly�
They begin the game with 1 point of Luck 
(explained on page 45)�
Equipment Load Out
Your squad begins with the following�
Each fire team receives:
  2 soldiers with assault rifles�
  1 soldier with assault rifle and 
grenade launcher
  1 soldier with squad automatic 
weapon
The squad leader receives:
  Pistol and assault rifle�
Weapon Options
You may opt to swap out some of your 
equipment at this stage: 
  You may swap one of your grenade 
launchers for a sharpshooter’s rifle�
  You may replace up to two of your 
assault rifles with shotguns or 
submachine guns�
Extra Squad Weapons
One soldier in the squad has an anti-tank 
weapon in addition to their primary 
weapon� They must be armed with an 
assault rifle, shotgun, or submachine gun� 
Note: You receive one anti-tank weapon 
for the squad, not for each fire team� 
Military weapons are detailed further on 
pages 58-61�
Alternate Types of Squads
If you prefer to use an alternate approach 
to things, you will have to substitute in the 
appropriate weapons� We recommend not 
being hung up on the exact performance 
of a given weapon� Just look at the 
general type: If you want to use a WW2 
squad instead, count each weapon as its 
closest comparison: WW2 US Rangers 
would have M1 rifles instead of the M4 
or M16, but they can be treated the same; 
a bazooka stands in for the anti-tank 
weapon, and so forth�
Even if you are not an expert on military 
firearms, a careful look at the various 
weapon types in the game should allow 
you to match things up in a way that 
makes reasonable sense�
Some players will not be interested in 
portraying a specific military unit� If 
so, you have the advantage that you can 
purchase any military figures you like and 
put them to use� As before, you should 
have no problem adapting any figures 
you find since the weapons are already 
fairly broad categories� We encourage you 
to have fun with the figures you are most 
excited about�
When using generic figures like this, we 
suggest that you use the standard squad 
organization presented in this rulebook�
If you want to modify the way squads 
are organised, bear in mind that this can 
change the balance of the game, especially 
if the amount of firepower changes 
significantly� Just go into your modified 
campaign expecting that you may need to 
tweak a few other things here and there, 
such as enemies encountered or rewards, 
and you should be fine�

STORY POINTS
A procedurally generated combat game 
can be exhilarating because you never 
know what is going to happen, but it 
can also throw something completely 
devastating at you� Players tend to take 
two different views of this: Some enjoy 
the feeling of an adventure where you 
truly don’t know what will be on the 
other side – sometimes you simply have 
to retreat to fight another day� Others 
prefer a story where the outcome is 
probably going to be okay� 
We offer Story Points as a way to tailor 
the game experience more to your liking� 
Think of Story Points as the rules giving 
you permission to experiment with the 
outcomes a little bit� While this is an 
included part of the game rules, you may 
opt not to use it if you prefer a more 
unflinching game experience�
Story Points are earned and spent as you 
play� Once a given point is spent, it is 
not regained, though you can earn more 
later on� 
You begin with 5 Story Points�
A Story Point may be spent to do several 
different things� You will note that some 
of these are very mechanical, while others 
are more open-ended� You may opt to use 
only the mechanical ones if you want your 
game to be more “by the book”�
Story Point Usage
Each Story Point may do any ONE of  
the following:
  When one of your characters 
attempts any action in combat that 
requires a D6 to be rolled, change 
the result to any number you like� If 
multiple dice are rolled, only one can 
be changed� 
  When you are attacked, you may 
avoid all effects of the attacks of one 
enemy figure in one battle round�
  When making a D100 roll on a table, 
you may roll twice and pick either 
outcome� In the event you roll the 
same result again, pick any outcome 
you like on the table� 
  Upgrade a soldier to become a 
known personality�
  Upgrade a soldier to gain an Advance 
(see page 117)� 
  Gain 2 Exposure (see page 121)� 
  Gain 1 Support Points (see page 77)�
  Gain 1 ally roll (see page 69)�
  Increase the number of available 
replacements in the campaign by one�
  If it makes sense to your story to have 
an event happen, have it happen! This 
can include picking a specific type of 
enemy to fight for a battle, having an 
ally show up to help you, acquiring a 
specific item, and so forth�
Note that some players love making their 
own lives difficult� A change that would 
make the game more difficult without 
giving you any benefits does not have to 
be paid for�

FIELD EXERCISES
When you have read through all the 
combat rules and created your squad, 
we recommend you start your journey 
by playing through these field exercises� 
These omit many of the detailed rules but 
allow you to get a feel for how movement, 
combat, and the turn sequence works� If 
you are a veteran miniatures gamer, you 
can skip this chapter, but we suggest that 
you take this opportunity to get to grips 
with the rules� 
You should use the actual squad you are 
going to play with in the campaign, but do 
not use any other campaign rules: You do 
not roll for injuries, gain advancements, 
and so forth�
For each exercise, you need a table space 
that is about 24"x24"�
Pick five terrain pieces that look like they 
fit together, such as five big rocks, and 
spread them out around the table�
Add two or three more pieces of terrain 
after each exercise� 
Set up the two sides 18" apart� 
Exercise 1: Basic Combat
  Pick one of your two fire teams  
(four soldiers in total) and set them 
up on one side of the table�
  You will be facing two mobs of  
four orc warriors each, which will 
deploy opposite you (see page 104)� 
Separate the mobs by about 4"�
  Use the Movement and Combat rules 
(pp�37-47)�
  Do not use Leadership Tactics, 
Aggression, Investigations, 
Objectives, or anything else yet�
  The objective of the exercise is to 
destroy all of the orcs�
Exercise 2: Infantry Tactics
  Pick the other fire team that you did 
not use in Exercise 1� Also add your 
platoon sergeant� 
  You will be facing two mobs:  
1x 6 orc warriors and 
1x 6 orc archers (see page 54)� 
The archers must be set up in Cover 
(see page 31)� Place some trees or a 
low wall for them to skulk behind� 
  You may use a single Leadership 
Tactic in this mission (see page 48)� 
  The objective of the exercise is to 
destroy all of the orcs�

Exercise 3: Patrol in Force
  For this mission, you receive the full 
squad of both fire teams and the 
squad leader� 
  You will be facing two mobs: 
1x 5 orc warriors and 
1x 5 orc archers� 
One of the warrior mobs should 
set up out of sight behind a terrain 
feature and the archers should set 
up in Cover� 
  You may use a single Leadership 
Tactic in this mission� 
  The objective of the exercise is to 
move to the center of the table and 
have a soldier spend an action 
there, then retreat off your own 
battlefield edge� 
Completion
Congratulations, soldier, there may be 
hope for you yet! Now clean off your kit 
and get back to barracks!
You are now ready to begin the 
campaign� You receive 2 Support Points 
immediately as a reward for paying 
attention in class, allowing you to go 
into your first campaign battle with a 
bit of extra help� Support Points can be 
cashed in for benefits in combat such as 
fire support or additional help and are 
explained on page 77�

DIFFICULTY FACTORS
This chapter provides a range of options 
to make the game easier or more 
challenging� 
We suggest that you begin the game using 
the rules as written, then once you have 
some experience with how the game 
mechanics work you can go back and try 
some of these options� Of course, if you 
already know you want a more heroic 
experience or a more grueling one, feel 
free to jump right in�
If you are introducing the game to a new 
player or someone not familiar with 
miniatures gaming, it may be a good 
idea to use a couple of the options to 
ease into things�
You can pick any number of options 
below, though note that options that are 
directly contradictory cannot both be 
selected� The Heroic options make the 
game easier while the Gritty options 
make the game harder� 
For players who enjoy keeping track, you 
can calculate a simple Difficulty Factor� 
An unmodified game has a Difficulty 
Factor of 0� Each Heroic option reduces 
the Difficulty Factor by the listed amount 
while each Gritty option increases it� 
If you complete a campaign, you can 
track the Difficulty Factor and resolve to 
increase it next time� 
Do not be Afraid to Come Back
Many of these options won’t make as much 
sense until you know how the game works� 
You can always come back to this section 
when you are ready� If you are uncertain 
after reading this section, just leave it 
alone for your first campaign� 


---

## Page 29

SQUAD CREATION
27
Another way of using this system is to 
use it as a purchase system� If you want to 
have a particular Heroic option, you need 
to “buy” it by also picking Gritty options 
until the Difficulty Factor is 0 (or whatever 
score you want to play at)� 
Each option modifies the Difficulty 
Factor by the number of points listed�
Note that if you are not too worried 
about keeping track of your play 
throughs, you can simply pick the 
options you think would be most 
fun� The score is strictly for your own 
education and does not affect gameplay� 
If you are playing alongside a friend and 
want to compare results, you will want 
to use the same Difficulty Factor, though 
you might select different options�

Victory Point Modifier
When determining your Victory Points at 
the end of the campaign, a multiplier is 
used� The multiplier starts at x1.0� Each 
point of Difficulty Factor changes it ±0.1 
up or down�
For example, if you earn 8 Victory Points 
and used a Difficulty Factor of +2, you 
would multiply by 1.2 for a final Victory 
Point score of 9.6�

TERRAIN RULES
This was just Tuesday for them. 
Never mind all that supernatural otherworldly horror. It was Tuesday for Rangers.
– Forgotten Ruin
Terrain Types 
Gaming terrain can take a wide range 
of forms and shapes, and different 
players will enjoy building very different 
collections to use in their games� We use a 
broad set of definitions to handle terrain 
by assigning each terrain piece to a 
category� Before fighting your battle, take 
a few moments to evaluate what you want 
each terrain feature to count as�
Linear
Any long, wide feature that a miniature 
cannot generally be placed on top of� 
Examples: stone walls, fences, or 
hedgerows� 
Individual
A single piece of terrain that a figure 
cannot climb� Examples: barrels, 
individual trees, or signposts� 
Area
Features that cover a larger space on the 
table and which miniatures can be placed 
inside� Area features block Line of Sight 
(see page 31)� Some may be designated as 
Difficult terrain (see below) if they are 
challenging to move through� Examples: 
forest, bushes, and rubble�
Field
Similar to an Area feature, except that 
such terrain does not block Line of Sight� 
Field features may also be designated 
as Difficult if they challenge movement, 
or Impassable if they cannot be moved 
through at all� Field terrain cannot 
provide Cover (see page 31)� Examples: 
mud, water, and lava pools� 
Block
Block terrain can be climbed or otherwise 
interacted with, but figures cannot enter 
it� Block terrain prevents Line of Sight� 
Examples: boulders or locked buildings� 
Interior
An enclosed terrain piece that figures 
can enter� Examples: buildings, tunnels, 
and caves� 
Interaction with Terrain
Block and Linear features can generally 
be climbed� 
Area features can be entered, as can many 
Field features�
The “Movement” rules chapter discusses 
movement in detail�
Difficult and Impassable Terrain
Some terrain features may be designated 
as Difficult terrain� This affects the 
speed at which figures can cross such 
terrain� Difficult terrain will consume an 
additional 1" of movement allowance for 
every full 2" moved in it� Difficult terrain 
includes features such as forest, swamp, 
rubble, and sand� Figures that fly may do 
so without reduced movement� 
Impassable terrain cannot be crossed by 
any figure�
Some figures move by flying and may 
ignore terrain features�

## Page 33

COMBAT rules
31
Lines of Sight and Cover
A Line of Sight is an imaginary line 
between two figures establishing whether 
they can see and fire upon each other� 
In most cases, visibility is obvious� If in 
doubt, lean down and take a look from 
behind one of the figures to get a “true” 
Line of Sight� If you can see the whole 
figure, then they can be fired at with no 
penalty� If you are uncertain, and the 
positioning is awkward, a laser line tool, 
or a length of string pulled taut can be 
used to check� 
Lines of Sight are considered mutual by 
default� If you can see them, then they can 
also see you!
If a figure is obscured by certain types  
of terrain that they are adjacent to 
(within 1"), it is assumed that figure 
is using it to avoid being hit by an 
attacker, in which case, they gain the 
benefit of Cover�
Cover
A figure is considered to be in Cover if:
  The Line of Sight to the figure is 
partially obscured by a piece of 
terrain�
  A Linear obstacle is between the 
shooter and target� This does not 
apply if the shooter is within 1" of 
the obstacle and the target is more 
than 1" from it� 
  The target is within an Area feature�
Being in Cover benefits the target by 
making it more difficult to be hit with 
ranged attacks� This is discussed in the 
combat rules�
Miniature figures are often in dramatic 
poses, and it is best to ignore raised 
arms, legs, and other extremities that are 
sticking out of Cover, when the figure is 
clearly placed behind a terrain feature� 
Other than that, however, the game 
usually flows best if you are generous: 
3"
No Line of Sight
A
Line of Sight and Cover
NOT TO SCALE
3"
Enemy A is hiding in a forest but is at the edge 
and so is visible. The red soldier and Enemy A 
share Line of Sight. Enemy A also has Cover 
because they are within an Area feature, 
but the soldier does not.
Enemy B is not at the edge so 
is not visible. Enemy B and 
the soldier share no 
Line of Sight.
Forest (Area terrain)
Low wall 
(Linear terrain)
1"
Enemy C and the red soldier 
are both beyond 3" of a low 
wall that lies between them. 
No Line of Sight exists unless 
one of them moves within 1" 
of the wall.
Enemy D is within 1" of the 
wall, and so share Line of 
Sight with the red soldier  
Enemy D has Cover because 
this Line of Sight crosses the 
terrain feature.

## Page 34

COMBAT rules
32
If you are uncertain, assume a figure is 
visible but in Cover unless it is clear it 
would not be visible at all�
Shooting across Linear Obstacles 
Linear obstacles are ignored for Line 
of Sight purposes if the target figure 
is entirely visible over them without 
being obscured at all� This is typically 
the case when the shooter is placed on a 
raised terrain feature, such as a rooftop� 
Otherwise, Line of Sight exists, and the 
target receives the benefits of Cover (unless 
the shooter is within 1" of the obstacle)�
Shooting Past Things 
In an intense firefight, the target is often 
partially obscured by something such as 
a boulder or a tree� If the Line of Sight 
crosses an individual terrain piece, Line 
of Sight is not blocked as long as they are 
at least partially visible� 
It can be difficult to tell if a single terrain 
item in the open like that provides Cover� 
If you are not sure, divide the distance 
between shooter and target in half� Items 
closer to the target than to the shooter 
provide Cover� 
Shooting Past People 
If Line of Sight is partially obscured by 
another figure, Line of Sight is blocked 
regardless of which side the intervening 
figure belongs to� 
Area Features 
Line of Sight into an Area feature such as 
a forest terminates at the nearest edge 
to the shooter� If a figure is placed in the 
feature but is touching an edge, they can 
see out and in turn be seen from that side 
of the edge�
Figures within an Area feature and not 
touching an edge cannot see figures on the 
outside, but all figures in an Area feature 
can see figures within the same feature 
if they are within 3" of each other� You 
cannot see across Area features otherwise�

THE BATTLE ROUND
Each battle is split into a number of battle 
rounds during which every character 
on the table has a chance to act� A battle 
round is not a fixed period of time but 
may represent between a few seconds 
of intense fighting and a few minutes if 
things are quieter�
In each round you will carry out the 
following phases in order:
1� The Reaction Roll
2� Quick Actions
3� Enemy Actions
4� Slow Actions
5� Aggression Phase
6� End Phase
Note that in some cases a phase may 
be empty� For example, if every soldier 
is acting in the Quick Actions Phase 
or if there are no enemies on the table 
currently� Technically, you still carry out 
the phase, but of course nothing happens� 
Take the opportunity to double check that 
you did not miss anything, and then just 
move on�
The Reaction Roll
The first step in each battle round is 
to find out who acts when� The enemy 
always acts in the Enemy Actions Phase, 
but a Reaction Roll must be made for 
your soldiers: Roll a number of D6 equal 
to the number of soldiers you currently 
have on the battlefield (ignoring those 
who have become casualties or have 
left) plus a D6 for each figure with 
Leadership (see boxout)� 
Each die is assigned to one of your 
characters as you see fit� If you have any 
dice left over, the rest are discarded with 
no effect�
  If the die assigned to a character is 
equal to or below the Reaction score 
of the character, they will act in the 
Quick Actions Phase� 
  If the die is higher than their 
Reaction score, they will act in the 
Slow Actions Phase�
Note that spell-casters also use the 
assigned die as the amount of magical 
Power they have available (see page 50), 
so make sure to assign a die that is high 
enough to cast any spell you want to use� 
Every figure always acts every battle 
round� If a character is not assigned a 
die for any reason, they act in the Slow 
Actions Phase�
Leadership
Your squad leader has the 
Leadership skill� If your platoon 
leader is on the table, they also 
have the Leadership skill (and it is 
cumulative with your squad leader)� 
However your platoon NCO and any 
fire team leaders do not�

---

## Page 36

COMBAT rules
34
Snap Fire and Delays
A character assigned a Quick Action die 
may forego acting in that phase� If so, 
they may Snap Fire on an enemy while 
the enemy is moving� You may fire either 
before an enemy moves, mid-way through 
their move, or at the end of their move� 
If firing on an enemy mob, move each 
figure in the mob as noted above and then 
resolve the shot� Mobs will try to spread 
out as much as possible if they are being 
Snap Fired upon with explosives�
Such fire is never considered to be aimed 
and the character cannot take any other 
actions this round� A character that does 
not act in the Quick Actions Phase or Snap 
Fire may act normally in the Slow Actions 
Phase instead�
Aggression Phase
This rule is not used in battles during 
the first two campaign turns, though you 
may opt to use it straight away if you have 
already completed a campaign� 
The enemy is both out to get you and 
has plenty of bodies to throw at you� 
We measure their schemes through 
their Aggression score�
At the end of every battle round, 
roll 1D6 to determine the amount of 
Aggression generated, and tally up 
the total score from round to round� 
If a villain is on an Objective or 
Investigation marker, add +1 to the 
score for each villain in such a position� 
Every time the score reaches or exceeds 
10, roll immediately on the Aggression 
table below and apply the result� The 
score is then reset to 0 unless the table 
says to do otherwise� Excess points above 
10 have no additional effect� 
Aggression table
D100 Aggression result
01-10 Replacements
Every mob on the table adds 1 additional figure� If there are currently no 
mobs on the table, treat as “Reinforcements”, below�
11-20 Reinforcements
A new enemy mob arrives from their table edge� Roll 1D6:
1-3:  They begin the game Unaware, but the new Aggression total is set 
equal to the die roll�
4-6:  They are Aware when they arrive, and Aggression is set to 0, as 
normal� If the new mob would be the only mob on the table, it is 
always Aware�
The mob size will be 1 lower than normal�
21-30 Renewed effort
The enemy mob closest to your table edge adds 3 additional figures�  
If there are no mobs on the table, treat as “Ambush”, below�

COMBAT rules

D100 Aggression result
31-40 Ambush
A new enemy mob is placed in or by the terrain feature nearest the center of 
the table� It is automatically Aware� The mob size will be 1 lower than normal�
41-50 New wave
Remove every enemy mob and replace them with the same number of 
new mobs (generated from scratch) arriving from their table edge� All 
replacement mobs increase their figure count by +1� If any champions 
are removed in this fashion, the new Aggression total is set to 1 for each 
champion that was removed�
If there are no current mobs, treat as “Ambush”, above�
51-65 Revelations
Place a champion with each of two random enemy mobs� Each of these extra 
champions you kill grants you 1 point of Exposure after the mission is over�
If there is only one mob, it receives a single champion� If there are no mobs, 
treat as “Reinforcements” instead�
66-70 Hero
Randomly select a champion or villain which gains 2 Monster Points� 
If none are present, upgrade one figure in a random mob to champion 
status and give them 2 Monster Points� If the table has no mobs on it, treat as 
“Monster”, below�
71-90 Monster
A monster arrives from a random neutral table edge�
91-00 Artifact
An enemy champion is placed with a random enemy mob� If you can kill this 
champion in hand-to-hand combat or kill them by shooting and then reach 
the location where they were killed, you receive a bonus Loot roll you may 
use immediately�
Any new figures that arrive during this 
step will act normally from the next battle 
round onwards� 
Champions placed with a mob are 
always of the same basic type, so an orc 
warrior mob will receive an orc warrior 
champion, for example� (For more on 
champions, see page 102)�
Added Aggression Variety 
(optional rule)
If you prefer not to duplicate results 
during a battle, each result on the table 
can occur only once� If you roll a result 
you already had, take the first (lowest 
number) result that has not occurred yet 
in the current battle� This counter resets 
each battle�

End Phase
During this point in the round, any “end 
of battle round” activities occur� If there 
are currently none of your soldiers on the 
table, the mission ends immediately�
If you completed the last Objective in 
the mission during this round, make a 
Sudden Death check (see page 112) to see 
how the mission will end�
There may be other events that occur at 
the end of a battle round� You may carry 
these out in any order you like, or in the 
order most advantageous to you, applying 
the results of each in turn� 
If the game has not concluded yet 
(through no soldiers remaining on the 
table or through the Sudden Death 
check), another round is played� The game 
proceeds this way until it does end� 
Activations 
Within a specific phase, all of your 
soldiers that activate in that phase can 
do so, in any order you like� When you 
select a soldier, they must finish all 
their activities before the next soldier 
is selected, and when you select a new 
character you cannot go back to a prior 
one that phase� For example, any unused 
movement ability or actions cannot be 
held back for later in the round�
Actions
When a character is activated, they may 
make a Move followed by an Action (such 
as firing a weapon, casting a spell, or using 
an item)� Note that you are not required to 
do both: A figure might want to only move 
or to stand still and shoot� You may not 
change the order, however�
A figure contacting an opponent while 
moving does not take an Action� Instead, 
they lose any remaining movement and 
then fight in hand-to-hand combat (see 
page 42)�
Other actions can become available as 
well as part of a scenario, Objective, or 
battle interaction� For example, a soldier 
finding some loot on the battlefield may 
require an action to dig it up and claim it� 
Free Actions
Certain activities are considered Free 
Actions� A soldier may take a single Free 
Action during their activation without 
limiting their other activities� Soldiers 
taking the “Second Free Action” option 
below may perform a total of TWO Free 
Actions at the cost of their normal Action� 
The most common use of Free Actions is 
to use Consumable items such as scrolls 
or potions�
Action Description
Fire Fire any ranged weapon carried or throw a grenade� (See page 40�)
Dash Move faster� Only usable if you choose to also Move� (See page 37�)
Interact Attempt to resolve a Mission Objective that requires Interacting� 
(See page 75�)
Spell-casting This action can only be taken by spell-casters� (See page 50�)
Tactical Awareness* Reduce Aggression by -1� (See page 34�)
Call Fire Support* If fire support is available, attempt to call it in� (See page 47)� 
Second Free Action Take a second Free Action (see above)�
*Only one soldier per battle round can attempt this action�

Movement
When moving, a figure can move up to 
their Speed in tabletop inches� Figures 
can move less if desired and can turn as 
often as they like� If a rule or circumstance 
requires that a figure move at half-
pace (such as firing a weapon with the 
Heavy trait), no rounding up or down is 
required: numerically halve the number 
of inches� For example, 5" movement 
halved would become 2.5"�
When moving in Difficult terrain, every 
2" of terrain moved through uses up 
1" additional movement allowance (so 
moving 2" would cost 3" of movement)� 
If insufficient movement allowance is 
available to pay the penalty� the figure 
must halt immediately upon reaching 
the 2" mark� If less than 2" of movement 
takes place within the Difficult ground, no 
penalty is paid� 
When interacting with buildings, it costs 
1" to move through a door or door-sized 
entrance point� Climbing through a 
window or window-sized hole costs 2"� 
Human-sized figures can never move 
through other figures unless they move 
by flying� 
Monsters can push aside human-sized 
figures belonging to their own side as  
they move� 
Turn and 
Dash (+2")Normal Move
Normal Move
Dash (+3")Normal Move
Dashing
A figure can use their Action to Dash� This 
allows them to move an additional 2"�
This is increased to 3" if all 
of the extra movement is in a 
straight line�
Figures with four (or more!) legs 
add +1" to all Dash distances�
A character cannot enter hand-
to-hand combat when Dashing�
Entering Hand-to-hand Combat
If a moving figure contacts an enemy, they 
enter hand-to-hand combat� They lose the 
ability to perform any other activities for 
the activation�
Hand-to-hand combat is resolved at the 
end of the current phase once every figure 
that activated this phase has had a chance 
to move and take actions� See page 42 for 
how to resolve hand-to-hand combat�
Note that a character with the Flexible 
knack cannot fire and then move into 
hand-to-hand combat as part of the  
same action�
Veteran “5X” players should note that 
this works differently from Five Parsecs 
from Home or Five Leagues from the 
Borderlands�
Moving Up and Down
Vertical terrain features can be climbed 
by paying a movement cost equal to 
the feature’s height + 1"� For example, 
climbing a 3" tall feature costs 4" of 
movement� This requires that the feature 
is obviously climbable� Most natural 
features such as cliffs, trees, and so forth 
are, but a building may or may not be� Use 
the actual terrain model as a guide�
Characters cannot climb as part of a  
Dash move�


---

## Page 40

COMBAT rules
38
A figure cannot partially climb a feature�  
If you have insufficient movement to reach 
the top, you cannot attempt the climb� As 
a result, features taller than the available 
movement cannot be climbed unless there 
is a ledge or platform part-way up� 
Some features are Unclimbable, such as 
a sheer ice wall� This is up to the player to 
decide� You might want to take a moment 
to look at your terrain features before the 
game begins and decide what might not 
be climbable� 
Dropping and Falling
A character at the edge of a feature can 
jump down� Characters may also fall for 
various reasons� Measure the distance 
down� Subtract 1" if you intentionally 
jumped down� A figure dropping over 1" 
ends their activation� 
Every full 3" fallen inflicts a damage  
+0 Hit (see page 44)� For example, a 
character falling 7" would take 2 Hits�
Leaping
A character may try to jump over a gap, 
chasm, or similar� This cannot be wider 
than 2", and the available movement 
allowance must be enough to reach the 
other side� Roll 1D6: On a 1, the character 
falls, and may take damage (see Dropping 
down, above)� On any other roll they make 
the jump: pay the width of the gap from 
the remaining movement allowance and 
carry on moving if desired� 
Random Movement
Some events can cause a character to 
move randomly� If so, make a random 
direction roll and move the character 
in the indicated direction� If they would 
collide with a terrain feature or another 
character, they halt� 
A randomly moving character contacting 
an enemy enters hand-to-hand combat�
The Edge of the Battlefield
A soldier that intentionally moves to 
contact any battlefield edge is removed 
from play� They cannot return during 
the mission but will rejoin your squad 
afterwards� This is commonly used to 
retreat from a mission that has become too 
hot� It does not have to be the battlefield 
edge you initially deployed nearby�
Enemies will not intentionally contact 
battlefield edges.
Events, spells, and effects can result in a 
figure moving randomly� Enemies that 
contact the battlefield edge are moved 
from play, while soldiers may opt to stop 
half an inch short or leave play�
Note: No ability can intentionally push a 
figure off the battlefield� 
Archer Mobs
Archer mobs should conduct movement 
with all of their figures first, then carry 
out any shooting (instead of moving and 
shooting with one figure at a time)� For 
more on archer mobs, see page 54�
Leaving the Battlefield
Your soldiers may move off the 
battlefield by moving into contact with 
any battlefield edge� This removes the 
character from the battle, and that soldier 
cannot return during this engagement�
Note that you do not have to specifically 
move off the battlefield edge you initially 
set up near� Your soldiers are well trained 
to exfiltrate from a dangerous situation 
and can make it to safety under cover of 
darkness� They will rejoin you after the 
battle and do not have to test for injuries�

Conditions
Stunned
When struck in combat, a character 
may become Stunned� This is shown by 
placing a small marker next to them� Up 
to 3 Stun markers can be accumulated by 
a figure; any in excess of that are ignored�
When a Stunned figure activates, they 
may either Move or take an Action, but 
cannot do both in the same activation� 
They may still take a Free Action� 
After the character finishes their 
activation, remove one Stun marker� 
Knocked Down
Some game effects can cause a figure to 
be Knocked Down. When the figure is 
activated next, they cannot move from 
their location, but they may take an Action 
(except Dash) and can fight normally� 
While Knocked Down, the figure is 
treated as being in Cover from ranged 
attacks� Once a figure has completed an 
activation, they recover�
Duplicate knockdowns have no  
additional effect�
Stunned Down
If a figure is both Stunned and 
Knocked Down at the same time, treat 
the character as being Knocked Down� 
After the figure activates next, remove 
both the Knocked Down token and 
one Stun token.
Unaware
An enemy mob may begin the game 
Unaware, representing them being half 
asleep, busy doing some task, or confused 
about what is going on� If this is the case, 
they do not take any actions until they 
become Aware: 
Each time the mob would activate, roll 
1D6, subtract 1, and tally the score (from 
0 to 5)� You can place a ten-sided die 
next to the unit to keep track� When the 
total score reaches or exceeds 10, the 
mob becomes Aware and immediately 
begins acting normally in the current 
battle round�
If there are multiple Unaware mobs, 
each has its own tally�
If an Unaware mob takes a Hit for any 
reason, is targeted by a spell, or a soldier 
comes within 6" and Line of Sight of any 
member of the mob, they become Aware 
immediately�
The Buddy Check
A character beginning a move or 
moving into contact with a Stunned 
character can give up their Action 
to remove 1 Stun marker from the 
character they contacted�

COMBAT
There are two types of combat: 
Shooting requires a ranged weapon such 
as a rifle, bow, or machine gun, and is 
done by taking an Action� It consists of 
one character attacking a target� 
Hand-to-hand combat can be done by 
any character by moving into contact with 
an enemy (although having a hand-to-
hand weapon such as a sword is highly 
recommended!)� Hand-to-hand combat 
is simultaneous and either (or both) 
characters can end up getting hit� 
In addition, to these two types of  
combat, some spells have offensive 
capabilities� Spells are covered in the 
following chapter�
Shooting
When taking an Action, a character 
may fire a single ranged weapon that 
they carry� 
Note: Some weapons limit the ability of 
a figure to move in the same turn� For 
example, all weapons with the Heavy 
Weapon trait cannot be fired if the figure 
moved at more than half pace (see the 
Military Weapons table, page 59)�
Stationary Shooting
For the purpose of whether a figure has 
moved, only count the current activation� 
Figures will often move around due to 
follow-up moves after hand-to-hand 
combat or being pushed around by effects 
on the table, but this does not affect their 
ability to shoot�
Target Selection
Characters may shoot at any target they 
like unless they are within 3" of hostiles, 
in which case they must shoot at the 
closest target� The enemy always shoots 
at the closest visible character� If a mob 
is shooting, they will spread their shots 
evenly across any soldiers that are within 
2" of the closest target� 
When shooting at enemy mobs, you must 
target the closest figures visible in the 
mob� You cannot pick off a champion at 
the back, for example� 
You cannot target a figure that is in hand-
to-hand combat with a friendly figure� 
This is typically only the case when figures 
have moved into hand-to-hand combat in 
the same phase, but the combat has not 
yet been resolved� 
Attack Dice
A weapon receives a number of attack 
dice equal to the Shots rating of the 
weapon, each of which can represent a 
couple of arrows or a volley of bullets� 
Characters firing a weapon with multiple 
Shots may distribute them among figures 
within 2" of each other� For example, if 
you have 3 Shots, you could shoot at three 
different orcs that are within 2" of each 
other� Assign how many dice you want to 
assign to each target� When multiple Shots 
are taken, you can usually roll them all 
simultaneously: Apply the highest dice to 
the closest target, and so forth�

## Page 43

COMBAT rules
41
Hitting the Target
When your soldiers shoot, for each 
Shot against a target, roll 1D6, and add 
the Combat Skill of the firer and any 
applicable modifiers�
The roll required to Hit for a soldier is:
Target within 6" and in the open 3+
Target is in the open 4+
Target is in Cover 6+
Example:
Private Santiago opens up with a 
squad automatic weapon, which 
gives 4 Shots. Santiago has a +1 
Combat Skill and the targets are in 
the open (4+). The dice show a 2, 3, 
4, 6. Adding the +1 bonus to Hit and 
these become 3, 4, 5, and 7, giving us 
three Hits. 
Enemy archers shoot a little differently: 
Each figure receives one shot, and they 
do not add their Combat Skill to the rolls� 
Archery relies on volume of shots and not 
careful aiming, at least when orcs do it!
Target is in the open 5+
Target is in Cover 6+
For every Hit, consult the Hit Resolution 
section below (see page 44)�
Great Hits
Sometimes you can strike true and make a 
more impactful Hit� This rule only applies 
to your soldiers’ attacks, and does not 
apply to Explosive attacks or the enemies�
Rolling a natural 6 represents a Great Hit: 
Resolve the damage roll one additional 
time against the target� For example, 
an anti-rank rocket would inflict 5 Hits 
instead of the normal 4� Additional Hits 
from Great Hits only affect the target 
figure, and cannot be applied to any  
other figures�
In the example above, Santiago scored 
one Great Hit�

## Page 44

COMBAT rules

Hand-to-hand Combat
When characters make contact with an 
opponent, they will fight in hand-to-hand 
combat at the end of the current phase� 
Unlike shooting, hand-to-hand combat is 
simultaneous, with both sides trying to 
kill each other� 
If multiple combats are going to take 
place, they can be resolved in any order 
the player likes� Select any one of your 
soldiers and resolve their combat, then 
move on to the next soldier and keep 
going until all are done� 
Roll 1D6 for each of the two combatants 
and add their Combat Skill, as well as any 
modifiers that may apply (all modifiers 
are cumulative):
  If a combatant is on higher 
ground, add +1 to the score� 
  If the figure whose move did 
not trigger the hand-to-hand 
combat is behind a wall or similar 
obstacle, they add +1 to their score�
  An enemy fighting a Stunned 
soldier receives a +1 to the score 
(no matter how many Stun tokens 
the soldier has)� 
  Armaments: Enemies you 
encounter are all equipped to 
fight hand-to-hand, whether with 
swords, claws, or other implements� 
Your soldiers are limited to knives 
until they can find a better option� 
Any soldier that does not have a 
sword or similar melee weapon 
must suffer a -1 penalty to hand-to-
hand combat rolls� A pistol allows 
the soldier to avoid the penalty�
The character with the lower total score 
takes a Hit� On a draw, both characters 
take a Hit unless one is a monster and one 
is a normal sized character, in which case 
only the normal character takes a Hit� 
Any character that takes a Hit is 
pushed back 1"�
All Hits are resolved as explained below 
(see page 44)�
Example:
A ranger with a +1 Combat Skill is 
being attacked by an enemy with a 
+0 Combat Skill. 
The ranger is uphill, so counts as 
being on higher ground but does 
not have a sword or similar melee 
weapon. This gives them both a +1 
and a -1 modifier for a modified  
Combat Skill the same as their 
original Combat Skill: +1.
The ranger rolls a 4, +1 for a total 
score of 5. The enemy rolls a 3 for 
a total score of 3. The ranger wins 
the combat and will push back their 
enemy 1" and inflict one Hit on them.
Stuck
If a figure is unable to move back 1", 
they take a second Hit and, if they 
survive, the attacker must instead 
back up� This typically only happens 
when pushed into a corner� 
Note that characters are not Stuck 
if there are other figures behind 
them� In this case, they push 
the figure out of the way (or slip 
through their legs to the other side 
if it’s a large monster)� 
If a figure is pushed against a ledge, 
or falls, the defender may choose to 
remain on the ledge (and count as 
Stuck) or drop down (and risk falling 
damage – see page 38)� Enemies 
always fall�

COMBAT rules
43
The Follow-up Move
A character that kills their enemy may 
move 2" in any direction as a free move� 
This cannot be used to enter hand-
to-hand combat unless the victorious 
character is a monster� Enemies will use 
this to move towards the nearest visible 
soldier or will take cover otherwise�
Multiple Weapons
A soldier may have more than one 
suitable weapon for hand-to-hand 
combat� The first time each battle round 
they engage in hand-to-hand combat, 
pick which weapon they have readied� 
They will use that weapon for the rest of 
the round� 
Multiple Combatants
If a figure is in contact with multiple 
opponents, they must fight them 
simultaneously�
The lone figure fights as normal� The 
opponents roll a number of dice equal to 
the number of their figures, then picks the 
single highest die� In the event some of 
the figures can reroll dice, you may have 
to roll each figure separately, then pick 
the highest final die� 
If the soldiers outnumber an enemy, you 
may pick which of your soldiers is leading 
the fight�
Enemies will always lead with a champion 
in preference to a figure in a mob� If you 
are fighting multiple opponents and one 
is a champion, the champion will lead� 
Otherwise, pick at random� 
  If the lone figure wins, they may Hit 
any one of their opponents� If they 
are entitled to multiple Hits due to 
an ability or item, they can distribute 
the Hits among the targets as they 
see fit� 
  If the outnumbering side wins, they 
Hit twice: Once from the combatant 
leading the combat and once from a 
randomly selected other figure (even 
if there are three or more figures)�
  On a draw, the leading figure and 
the outnumbered figure are each 
Hit once� 
If at the end of the combat, the 
outnumbered figure is still in contact 
with any opponents, the outnumbered 
figure backs up 1", ending the combat 
unless they opt to use the Sweeping 
attack option below�
Sweeping Attacks
If the outnumbered figure kills the 
leading opponent and is now in contact 
with a single remaining combatant, they 
may choose to immediately fight again 
against the leftover opponent� Enemy 
champions and monsters will always do 
this; regular enemies will not� Soldiers 
may choose� 
Messy Combats
Hand-to-hand combat always has 
the potential to be messy as figures 
are crowded into spaces between 
terrain features or balancing on top of 
something� In some cases, you may have 
to move the figures a little for it to work� 
This can sometimes result in a figure 
having to back up a bit more than 1" 
when losing a combat� 

---

## Page 46

COMBAT rules
44
Hit Resolution
Any time a character takes a Hit, 
regardless of how it happened, roll 1D6 
and add the damage rating of the weapon, 
as well as any bonuses such as Great Hits� 
  Enemies always have a +0 damage 
rating unless their profile or special 
rules state otherwise�
  In hand-to-hand combat� use the 
damage rating of the weapon in 
question� Soldiers fighting without  
a hand-to-hand weapon count as  
+0 damage�
If the roll is equal to or above the 
Toughness of the target, they become 
a casualty and are removed from play� 
Monsters lose 1 Monster Point instead, 
and are removed from play once they 
have lost all of their Monster Points� 
If the roll is below the Toughness rating, 
the attack is not sufficient to produce a 
casualty� The attack may have caused a 
minor scrape or gone through the pants 
leg instead of striking true� Enemies 
and monsters are not affected at all, 
while soldiers receive a Stun marker 
unless they have 3 Stun markers 
already, in which case additional Stun 
tokens are ignored� 
Saving Throws
Some figures receive a saving throw due 
to armor, scaly hides, magical defenses, or 
other protective measures� This is always 
expressed as a die roll target number� A 
typical heavy suit of medieval armor like 
a brigandine or heavy mail hauberk might 
grant a 5+ saving throw, for example�
Whenever a figure with a saving throw is 
Hit, roll a D6:
If the roll is equal to or above the saving 
throw value, the Hit is deflected and has 
no effect� For example, a 5+ saving throw 
negates a Hit on a roll of 5 or 6�
If the roll is below the saving throw 
value, the Hit takes effect normally and 
the roll against Toughness is made (see 
Hit Resolution, above)� Note that soldiers 
who pass a saving throw do not receive a 
Stun marker� 
Multiple Saving Throws
If a character has multiple sources 
of saving throws, do not roll for each 
individually� Instead, the character 
receives a single combined saving throw 
which is 1 point below the single best 
saving throw provided� For example, a 
character with a 5+ and a 6+ saving throw 
would receive a single 4+ saving throw 
instead� Note that the saving throw is only 
ever improved by 1 point�
Saving Throw Negation
Some attacks do not permit saving throws� 
If so, all saving throws are ignored�
Example of getting Hit:
My rangers have opened fire on a 
mob of Toughness 4 enemies. We 
score 2 Hits with our rifles and roll to 
do damage. The dice show a 4 and a 
5, meaning both Hits were effective. 
If the enemies do not have a saving 
throw, they are both removed as 
casualties. 
In this case, the enemies have a 6+ saving 
throw so two dice are rolled with each 6 
indicating that the shot was deflected by 
their armor�

Luck
Some of your soldiers may have Luck� 
This can be that uncanny knack to always 
duck at the right time or just being 
fortunate� Among soldiers, any number 
of things may be declared lucky or 
unlucky from eating a particular type of 
food to saying a particular word� It may 
just save your life!
In battle, a soldier with Luck may ignore 
an incident that would cause them to 
become a casualty� Each point of Luck 
allows one such lucky break per battle� 
The character may immediately make 
a normal move in any direction as they 
dodge, weave, or tumble� If the attack had 
an area of effect, the character is moved 
out of the area of effect in any direction 
the player chooses�
For any special scenarios you create, Luck 
will avoid any incident that produces a 
casualty, including automatic ones such 
as falling into a pit of lava� The character 
should be placed in whatever position 
is nearest to the event, but which would 
be safe (they didn’t fall in after all, they 
landed on a ledge or similar)� 
Luck does not protect from any source 
of unpleasantness such as magical 
paralysis, shapeshifting, or teleportation� 
If you have a special scenario where an 
evil lich teleports you to the dungeon of 
seven thousand dragons, Luck won’t stop 
it (but may be awfully handy when you 
do arrive)�
Luck and Multiple Attacks
Resolve all Hits from a single mob, villain, 
or monster, then spend Luck� If a soldier is 
Hit three times by archery by a single mob 
in one round, they still only pay a single 
point of Luck�

Explosions
Weapons such as grenades produce an 
explosion� To attack with an explosive 
weapon, place an impact point within 
range and Line of Sight, and then make a 
single Hit roll normally� Count the attack 
as being against Cover if there is any 
intervening terrain between the attacker 
and the impact point�
A miss causes the impact point to move 
1D6" in a random direction, while a hit 
lands exactly where it was intended� If 
the impact point would move across 
an obstacle that is taller than the target 
figure, it impacts there instead� 
The blast radius of both your hand 
grenades and grenade launcher is 2"� 
You can use a circular template or just 
measure it out� 
All figures fully or partially within 
the blast radius are Hit automatically� 
You can use the base of the figure to 
determine if they are within the blast 
area or not� 
Figures that have partial terrain (or 
another figure) between them and the 
impact point or which are on higher 
or lower ground with some partial 
protection (such as a trench) are Hit on 
an unmodified D6 roll of a 4+� Explosions 
do not extend through intact walls� 
Resolve the attack using the damage of 
the weapon, as normal� 
Saving throws apply normally to 
explosive damage, but any figure that 
successfully saves is Knocked Down (they 
weather the blast instead of getting to the 
ground in time)� 
Note that using explosives near your own 
troops can be quite dangerous, and due to 
their limited range, hand grenades can be 
very unpredictable!
Grenade Targeting
Thrown and launched grenades do not 
have to target the closest figure in a mob� 
You may place the impact point anywhere 
within the target mob� 
Smaller Tables (optional rule)
If your gaming space is small, you may 
have figures bunching up more than 
normal� If explosive weapons feel a 
little too good, amend the rule so that a 
figure is Hit automatically if their base is 
completely within the blast radius and 
on a 4+ roll if they are partially within� 
Figures that are partially within the  
blast and have terrain in the way are Hit 
on a 6+�

Fire Support
"Steel Eight One, this is One Four. Request 
fire mission on TRP oh-eight-zero.”
– Forgotten Ruin
You may be supported by mortar fire 
during your missions� If you have fire 
support (when the scenario details say it 
is available), any character may attempt 
to call it in as an Action� Only one attempt 
is permitted per battle round�
Whenever a character tries to call in a fire 
mission, roll 1D6 + Wits for the character: 
If the roll is equal to or above the 
target number, the fire mission arrives 
immediately� Otherwise, it is unavailable 
this turn�
The target number for fire support to 
arrive is initially 4+� Every time a fire 
mission has been called successfully, the 
target number is increased by 1� Once 
the target number is high enough that 
none of your soldiers can succeed at the 
attempt, fire is no longer available� 
For example, if you succeeded on the 
first attempt, the next attempt will 
require 5+� If that next attempt results 
in a 3, you do not succeed, and the 
difficulty remains at 5+� 
A successful call for fire allows you to aim 
the fire mission anywhere in sight of the 
soldier calling the fire� Place a marker 
and roll 1D6� On a 5-6, it lands exactly 
where you wanted it� Otherwise, it is 
moved a number of inches equal to the 
die roll in a random direction�
A figure struck directly by the marker 
takes 3 Hits at +1 damage and is Knocked 
Down� All other figures even partially 
within 2" are Hit once at +1 damage, even 
if there is partial Cover between them 
and the impact point� 
Danger Close!
You may not target fire support in such a 
way that any of your own soldiers would 
be within the blast area if it is on target� 
However, if the fire mission is moved 
randomly, it may strike your soldiers, in 
which case they are affected normally�

Leadership Tactics
You have access to a range of tactical 
moves and doctrines to help win the 
day� These represent the ability of your 
leadership to pick just the right moment 
to push for extra effort or to lure the 
enemy in a preplanned tactical trap� 
Once per mission, you may invoke one 
of the following Leadership Tactics� Pick 
whichever Tactic will help the most� The 
effects last for the current battle round 
and affect every eligible soldier on the 
battlefield� Read the description of each 
Tactic carefully as some only target a 
single soldier or only target soldiers in a 
particular circumstance� 
Tactics table
Tactic Description Effect
Light them up! Rapid, accurate 
fire to thin down 
the enemy
Every soldier firing an assault rifle may shoot 
twice this turn� This includes soldiers with a 
grenade launcher if they fire the rifle portion of 
their weapon�
Firepower! Optimal 
application of 
heavy firepower
One soldier may shoot twice with one weapon 
carried
or
you may throw or launch an additional grenade 
this round�
Double time! Deploy into 
advantageous 
positions
Every soldier may move an additional 3" as part 
of their normal movement�
Bring it down! Concentrate 
fire to exploit 
weaknesses
Select one target� All attacks against this target 
that roll a natural 6 on the firing/hand-to-hand 
roll will score 2 Hits� 
Get stuck in! Positions must 
be carried by 
assault
Any of your soldiers in hand-to-hand combat 
may roll two dice and pick the best score�
By sections! Low-level unit 
tactics
Instead of rolling for Initiative, set half the dice 
(rounded up) to 2s and the other half (rounded 
down) to 4s�
Mortars! Indirect fire 
support
You may immediately fire a mortar attack 
using the Fire Support rules (p�47)� One Action 
is required, but no roll is required to call the 
mission� This option can only be selected if you 
do not have fire support in the mission already 
and must be targeted from your squad leader, 
platoon sergeant, or platoon leader� 
Shut your 
mouths!
Stealth and 
discretion
The mission Aggression score does not increase 
for any reason this round�

In some cases, you may be permitted to 
use multiple Tactics in a battle� You cannot 
select the same Tactic more than once per 
battle, however�
You can invoke a Tactic at any point of the 
round, but it will usually be most effective 
if used earlier in the round so more 
soldiers can benefit from it�
There are two approaches to using Tactics� 
You might use them to get the desired 
game effect and overcome the monsters 
or you might use them as a reflection of 
the kind of unit you are playing and the 
leaders in charge of it� Take a moment to 
consider the personality of your squad 
and platoon leaders when selecting 
an option� Maybe there is a clear 
preference they might have!

SPELLS 
I spent much of that night just thinking about the ‘intel’ I’d secured 
off the dead sorcerer. Our high-value target. That’s what PFC Kennedy had called the 
man we killed out there in the night. No—Kennedy had said ‘wizard.’ Not ‘sorcerer.’ 
Where was the line between such things?
– Forgotten Ruin
A wide range of spells are available to the 
curious and the slightly obsessed alike� 
Soldiers with the ability to use magic 
may cast one spell per battle round as an 
Action� They may select from any spell 
available to them� You do not have to 
choose which spell you want to use  
ahead of time�
Casting Spells
When the spell-casting figure activates, 
the Initiative die is also the amount of 
Power you have available� The character 
may cast any one spell with a Power score 
equal to or lower than the Power the 
character has available� 
For example, if you assigned a 3 to the 
spell-caster, they have 3 Power and may 
cast any spell with a Power cost of 3 or 
less� (You may want to leave Initiative 
dice next to such characters to help you 
remember�)
Excess Power cannot be saved up, but 
some items and features may modify the 
amount of Power you have available each 
battle round� In some cases, a spell-caster 
may be unable to cast a spell at all if their 
available Power is less than the cost of any 
of their spells�
You cannot cast two spells in one Action, 
even if you have enough Power to do so�
Note that enemies with spells do not use 
this system� Instead, they may cast a spell 
every time they activate� However, they 
must still use an Action to do so�
Spell Range
Spells with a range in inches can affect 
any target or point within that range 
that is visible to the caster� Note that any 
features that affect visibility also affect 
spell range� For example, if an event limits 
visibility to 8", the spell caster cannot cast 
spells on targets more than 8" away� 
Spell Targets
Each spell on the Spell table lists what 
type of target and how many it affects� 
Spells affecting a “target point” can be 
aimed at any point on the ground that is 
within range and Line of Sight�
If a spell affects multiple targets, they can 
be selected from any figures visible to the 
caster and within range� They do not have 
to be from the same mob unless the target 
number is enhanced (see below)� You can 
always choose to affect fewer targets if 
you like� 
Note for Experienced Wizards
Unlike in some fantasy games, there is no 
memorization system or limited-use spell 
slots� This helps move the game along, 
especially when multiple spell-casters may 
be in the squad�

## Page 53

COMBAT rules
51
Spell Resistance
Some spells can be resisted through 
willpower, counter spells, or plain luck� If 
the Resist column in the Spell table says 
“Yes”, each affected target rolls to resist: 
Roll 1D6 for each target figure and add 
their Resistance score� A final score of 6+ 
means they were not affected by the spell 
while a lower roll means they are� 
If a spell affects multiple targets, each will 
roll to resist individually� This can result 
in only some targets being unaffected� 
Note that Resistance rolls can succeed 
automatically (if the Resistance is +5 or 
greater after all modifiers are applied) or 
fail automatically (if the Resistance is -1  
or lower after all modifiers are applied)�
Spell Enhancement
If the available Power is greater than 
that required by the spell, extra Power 
can be invested to enhance the spell� Any 
combination of the following options can 
be selected:
  Extending: Spells with a range 
given in inches can be extended� 
Each extra point of Power spent 
adds +6" range�
  Additional Targets: Spells that 
affect a given number of figures can 
strike additional targets if they are 
targeting a single mob� Each extra 
point of Power spent affects +1 target, 
but only when targeting mobs� 
  Boosting: Spells that can be 
resisted can be boosted� For each 
extra point of Power spent, modify 
the Resistance roll by -1� This 
affects every target of the spell� 
Attack Spells
Some spells attack by inflicting damage� 
These are treated like Hits in combat, but 
do not have a Hit roll� Make saving throws 
(unless negated by the spell) and roll 
against Toughness normally� 
Spell Flavor 
Spells are described with a name and 
effect only – without description of its 
manifestation –allowing you to envision 
them in any way you like� Magic Dart 
might be the typical glowing magic arrow, 
but it could also be a bolt of flame, a 
psionic assault, or a flurry of silver knives 
that the spell-caster conjures up�

ENEMY ACTION PHASE
Enemy Movement on the 
Battlefield
Enemy figures all act during the Enemy 
Action Phase� Similar to soldiers, they 
always Move before taking an Action�
While your soldiers always act 
individually if desired, enemy grunts are 
organized into mobs�
All figures within a given mob must try to 
remain within 1" of each other at all times, 
forming a coherent unit� (Don’t worry 
about measuring exactly, eyeballing it 
is fine�) Mobs may separate further to 
navigate terrain or engage soldiers in 
hand-to-hand combat, as well as when 
taking casualties� This does not penalize 
them, but they should try to regroup next 
time they move�
Enemy mobs will act in one of two ways, 
depending on whether they have melee 
weapons or missile weapons�
Mobs with melee weapons will always 
attempt to move towards the nearest of 
your soldiers to get into hand-to-hand 
combat with as many soldiers as possible� 
They will attempt to use Cover when 
moving up but if they are within double 
their movement range of any of your 
soldiers, they are overcome by bloodlust 
and will move directly towards you as 
quickly as possible�
Archer mobs will move to find Cover 
within sight and range of the nearest 
soldiers, and then shoot at them� If a 
choice has to be made between being 
able to shoot or being in Cover, they 
will always prefer to shoot� Archers will 
not close the distance beyond what is 
required to be able to shoot� 
Enemies will Dash when activating in 
the open and moving towards Cover; 
otherwise, they move at normal pace� If a 
melee unit activates within two moves of 
your soldiers, they will Dash to close as 
much as possible� Archers will not Dash 
if they have an option to shoot at soldiers 
during their activation� If they cannot see 
or reach any soldiers, they will always 
Dash to get to a firing position�
Enemy characters act individually as do 
any creatures that are rated as monsters� 
Morale
While your soldiers are willing to do 
whatever it takes to complete the mission 
and protect their comrades, enemy mobs 
are not always so well motivated�
At the end of each phase, all enemy mobs 
must test for Morale if they suffered 
any casualties during the phase just 
completed� If you find that you often 
forget which mobs have to test, you may 
wish to place tokens, lie the casualty 
figures down, or place a red die showing 
the number of kills sustained by the mob�
Tally up the number of figures from the 
mob that were killed during the phase, 
and roll that number of D6s� Every 1 
on the Morale dice causes a figure to 
be removed (as they panic and flee the 
battle), and that die is then rolled again� 
Keep rolling until none of the dice 
show a 1� 
Figures should be removed from the back 
of the unit first� Champions (see page 102)
are always skipped, which can sometimes 
result in the champion being left as the 
only figure remaining�

---

## Page 57

COMBAT rules
55
Note: Some enemies are Fearless: They 
will not check Morale for any reason� This 
will be noted in The Enemy chapter�
Direct Morale Dice
Some events can cause Morale dice 
to be rolled� For example, the Fearful 
Image spell requires five D6 to be rolled� 
These dice are simply added to any dice 
required due to casualties, and the total 
can be rolled at once, without the need to 
separate them� 
Additional Morale Dice
Certain events or abilities can potentially 
increase the number of Morale dice� 
These have no effect unless a test was 
required already� 
Example:
A soldier has the War Cry 
Transformation upgrade, which 
adds a Morale die to mobs within 8". 
A mob required to roll 2 dice (due to 
casualties) would have to roll  
3 dice instead, but a mob that took 
no casualties would not be  
required to roll.
Villain Plans
During the campaign you may have 
encountered villains, particular enemy 
leaders with a heightened interest in 
ruining your day (see page 115)� If you have 
a villain on the table, they will act towards 
a specific purpose based on their own 
plans and motivations� 
Each game, the first time a villain 
activates to move, roll 1D6 on the table 
below to determine their goal� Villains 
will engage targets that are between them 
and their goal� If a villain is attacked or 
comes within less than a double move of a 
visible soldier, they will change their goal 
to eliminate that target, then roll again on 
the table after doing so�
D6 Villain Goal
1-2 Move towards the nearest 
Objective
3 Move towards the nearest 
Investigation
4 Move towards the nearest soldiers
5 Move towards the center of the 
battlefield
6 Move towards a randomly selected 
leader (fire team or platoon)


---

## Page 58

COMBAT rules
56
A villain that has reached a location 
they were aiming for will remain 
there, moving to engage 
soldiers within a double 
move of them� 
If the target is no 
longer applicable, such 
as the Objective being completed 
by the soldiers, they will instead 
target the last soldier to strike 
them with an attack, and the 
nearest soldier otherwise�
Note that a villain that 
is on an Objective or 
Investigation marker will 
generate +1 Aggression at 
the end of the battle round�
Big Monsters
Certain creatures are noted as being 
monsters� These receive certain special 
considerations in the game rules to 
account for their size, ferocity, and 
unpredictable behavior:
Dangerous: Monsters that roll a  
natural 6 on their combat die always 
inflict a Hit on the soldier even if they 
lose the combat� If the soldier’s combat 
roll is higher than the monster, they 
will still inflict a Hit on the monster and 
potentially stop it moving, as noted in 
Rampaging, below� 
Plodding: Monsters do not Dash� They 
only move at their basic movement speed�
Rampaging: Monsters cannot be stopped 
by just standing in the way� When a 
monster moves, it will fight hand-to-hand 
combat with each soldier it encounters� 
If a soldier wins, the monster halts, and 
damage is dealt normally� 
On a draw or a monster win, the soldier 
is pushed 1" out of the way as the monster 
finishes any movement� Note that the 
monster still takes a Hit on a draw� 
A soldier that has already been engaged in 
hand-to-hand combat during the monster 
move cannot be engaged again by the 
same monster that battle round (but the 
soldier could engage the monster on their 
own when they activate)� 
Sturdy: Monsters cannot be Knocked 
Down�
Villains Reconsider 
(optional rule)
Each time a villain is activated, roll 
1D6: On a 1, they reconsider their 
plan and roll again on the table on 
the previous page� On any other result, 
they stick to their existing plan�


---

COMBAT rules

Specific Monster Traits
In addition to the the general monster 
traits described above, many monsters 
have other monster traits specific to 
them, some of which may overrule 
general traits� See the full monster 
statistics on pages 99-101�
Monster Points
All monsters have a Monster Point 
(MP) rating which indicates how many 
successful Hits that score equal to or 
above their Toughness it takes to kill 
them� When reduced to 0 Monster Points, 
the monster is destroyed� A monster can 
keep fighting at full efficiency until it is 
reduced to 0� 
Example:
If a soldier fires at a monster with  
3 Monster Points and scores 2 Hits, 
both of which roll equal to or above 
the Toughness of the target, 2 MP 
are deducted, leaving 1 MP.
Monster Actions
For figures that count as monsters, 
roll 1D6 each time they are activated, and 
consult the table below� Add +1 to the roll 
if they lost any Monster Points during the 
current battle round� (Only a single +1 
applies, even if multiple MP were lost)�
Monster Action table
Result Action Description
1-2 Summon The monster activates magical signals, roars in rage, calls on 
its minions, or otherwise makes a racket� The monster remains 
in place and does not make any ranged attacks� Add +1 to the 
Aggression score� If the mission does not use the Aggression 
rule, the monster simply screams in rage, looks around 
stupidly, rips apart a nearby tree, eats a stray goblin, or looks 
even more menacing�
3-6 Move to 
Attack
The monster will move in such a way that it would 
contact as many soldiers as possible during its movement� 
See the monster combat rules (page 54) for details� 
7+ Go Berserk As “Move to Attack”, but it will activate twice in a row this 
battle round� 
Note: Monsters with ranged attacks will use them if they fail to contact any opponents 
while moving� They always target the closest visible soldiers� 
Streamlined Play Option
If you prefer to reduce the number of dice 
rolls, you can omit the monster and villain 
action rolls and simply have them act like 
any other enemy figure�

THE ARMORY
This section contains the rules and 
profiles for the various weapons that you 
will be employing in battle� Weapons are 
rated according to the following values:
Range: The tabletop range in inches� 
Targets beyond this range cannot be 
selected� If two values are given, use the 
lower if the soldier is moving and the 
higher if the soldier is stationary during 
their activation�
Shots: The number of attack dice rolled� 
If this says “Explosion”, the weapon uses 
the Explosion rules (see page 46)�
Damage: The value added to the D6 when 
rolling against the Toughness of the target�
Military Weapons
This list covers the military hardware 
your troops come equipped with� The 
Squad Creation chapter explains what 
weapons you can begin the game with 
(page 22)�
While military fiction is often enamored 
with clarifying whether a given rifle is 
the Mark II or Mark IIa, we’ve stuck to 
broad terminology here� This is both more 
welcoming to new players and serves to 
make the game adaptable�
While the rangers in the Forgotten Ruin 
novel have access to more technology, 
with drones and other kit, your platoon 
must make do with mostly what you can 
carry on your backs� 
Ordnance Limits
Note that grenades are limited in usage 
to two per battle round, whether thrown 
or launched� This is an abstraction to 
account for limited ammunition available, 
and saves us from tracking who still 
carries how many grenades� 
If you prefer to keep strict track, begin 
the campaign with 6 grenades for each 
grenade launcher, and 2 hand grenades 
for each soldier� You may redistribute 
grenades between missions but 
launched and thrown grenades are not 
interchangeable� If you use this method, 
you have no restriction on usage per 
round, and it is up to you to conserve or 
let fly as the situation demands� 
Realism Note: Weapons
Weapon ranges are compact to allow play 
on a smaller gaming table�
Many of these weapons are team weapons 
requiring a loader in real life to help the 
weapon function optimally� We don’t 
require this in gameplay to help avoid 
having to track who goes with which heavy 
weapon�
Also, the firepower gap between a modern 
military rifle and a crossbow is much 
greater than is reflected in the rules� Don’t 
worry about it too much; in playtesting, 
this has generally been the most flexible 
option to account for the combination of 
miniatures and table space�

Explosive: 2" radius explosion.
Ammo restriction: Only 2 soldiers per battle round may 
throw or launch a grenade.
Grenade launcher 15" Explosive (2" radius) +0
Attaches underneath a rifle barrel for added firepower.
Heavy weapon: The shooter cannot fire if they move beyond

Under-barrel: The soldier is also armed with an assault rifle 
and may fire either weapon when activated (but not both). 
When firing the rifle, 2" radius explosion.
Ammo restriction: Only 2 soldiers per battle round may 
throw or launch a grenade.
Realism Note: Anti-tank 
Weapons
Anti-tank weapons use a shaped charge 
warhead to burn through the target.  
They do not really produce a huge 
explosion like they do in the movies. 
Medieval Weapons 
While a volley of automatic weapons fire 
is typically a decent answer to angry orcs, 
commanders are advised to become well 
acquainted with the sorts of medieval 
implements the orcs might use to kill you.
Swords (and so forth)
This category includes all single-handed 
melee weapons that are not otherwise in 
another category.
These weapons are part of the profile 
of enemy figures. All enemies carry this 
weapon if nothing else is stated.
  Soldiers using a sword do not suffer 
the -1 unarmed penalty to hand-to-
hand combat.
  Swords hit with +0 damage.
Large Swords (and so forth)
A two-handed sword, axe, or similar.
  Soldiers using a large sword do not 
suffer the -1 unarmed penalty to 
hand-to-hand combat.
  A character using such a weapon 
adds +1 damage in hand-to-hand 
combat, but does not inflict a Hit if 
the combat ends in a draw as these 
weapons are slow to swing. 
Both bonuses apply to enemies and 
soldiers using such a weapon.
If both combatants are using large 
weapons, a draw ends with neither side 
scoring a Hit.

Poisoned Weapons 
A dagger or similar weapon, dripping 
with corrosive poison� 
  Poisoned weapons strike with  
+0 damage, but two dice are rolled 
and the highest result applied� 
  The metabolism of the enemies 
you are fighting is quite strange, 
and they are unaffected by poison 
(though they are still affected by the 
weapons themselves)� 
Bows and Crossbows
Any number of devices that use muscle 
power or simple mechanical power to 
launch arrows and bolts� While bows 
typically shoot faster and crossbows tend 
to hit harder, in game terms we treat 
them the same� 
  These weapons have a range of 18" 
and Hit with +0 damage� 
  Bows and crossbows do not add 
Combat Skill to the roll when used 
by the enemies�
There is no inherent benefit to your 
soldiers using these (although special 
scenarios could benefit from bows due to 
their lack of noise), but magical versions 
may be acquired�
No Weapon Looting
You cannot loot weapons from the 
enemies you kill during the campaign� It 
is assumed that their weapons are either 
unsuitable for human use, damaged 
during the fight, poisoned, or covered in 
sinister runes that no doubt would have 
dire results on anyone attempting to use 
them� No Jenkins, put that down�
What about this Very 
Specific Type of Weapon?
All melee weapons fit into the two 
basic groups based on whether it is 
single-handed or double-handed� For 
example, most maces, warhammers, 
and single-handed axes are counted 
as swords, while huge battle axes and 
polearms are counted as large swords� 
You don’t have to name them that 
way, of course – that’s just how they 
function within the rules�
Some miniatures are cast with very 
large weapons that they nevertheless 
wield single handedly� You may 
treat these in any way you like�

COMBAT rules

A TACTICAL PRIMER
The world of Forgotten Ruin can be a 
dangerous place, and it is worth keeping a 
few pointers in mind:
Stick together. Soldiers operate in fire 
teams for a reason and having a single 
soldier way off on their own means they 
are likely to get swarmed and overrun� 
Ideally your soldiers should be operating 
at least in pairs�
Deploy and move elements to support 
each other. Battle manuals talk about 
overlapping fields of fire, which means 
that two weapons are positioned so 
they can both fire at a central target� It 
also means if one of your groups gets 
in trouble, you can fire on whatever is 
bothering them from another angle� 
Don’t get bogged down. Once the 
Aggression clock starts ticking, the 
enemy will not stop coming, and you are 
better off getting a move on� Every battle 
round should see you making progress 
towards one of your Objectives, whether 
it is advancing on it or clearing away 
enemies nearby�
Use “leapfrogging” . This small unit 
tactic uses one element to provide fire 
support while another moves forward� 
When the forward element reaches 
their destination, they can then fire, 
while the rear element moves up� As 
many weapons are more effective from 
a stationary position, this allows you to 
keep up a steady base of fire while still 
making progress�
Choose the right weapon for the task. 
Shooting anti-tank rockets at infantry 
while your riflemen try to fight off a huge 
monster is unlikely to be successful� Plan 
where your heavy weapons need to go in 
order to be effective and get them there� 
Take time to consider your options.  
There is no rush to complete a battle 
round as quickly as possible� If you are 
in a difficult situation, take a moment to 
examine the state of the battlefield and 
the resources at your disposal� Forgotten 
Ruin provides a wide range of tools in 
the form of equipment, tactics, spells, 
and character abilities� There will almost 
always be some option available that you 
did not think of�
Recognize if you need to retreat. 
Most engagements have a very thin 
barrier between when you can still 
salvage things and when it is too late� 
Always bear in mind that if the situation 
looks bad now, it is likely to be much 
worse in two more rounds�

READYING THE CAMPAIGN
The campaign is played in a series of 
campaign turns during each of which you 
will fight a mission and then determine 
any outcomes from your action, such as 
experience, injuries, and rewards� To get 
your campaign started, simply go through 
this chapter step by step� 
Create Your Squad
First, go through the instructions in Squad 
Creation (see page 17) to prepare your 
squad for the game� 
The Map
Your campaign will need a map of the 
area you are adventuring in� Your platoon 
has landed far from where any of your 
comrades did and the land around you 
does not look recognizable at all� You will 
have to explore the landscape to find your 
comrades, and it looks like it will be a 
battle every step of the way�
You can draw a map yourself either by 
hand or using one of the many software 
options available for RPG purposes� 
You can also choose to use an existing 
map from a game world (or even use a 
real-life map, maybe turned sideways or 
upside down)� Using a local map of where 
you live, but making the names more 
fantastical can be a lot of fun� Some place 
names may suggest themselves quite 
readily: If you live near Phoenix in the 
United States, you might turn that into 
Phoenix Vale, for example� 
The map can be as intricate or as basic 
as you like: Some players get lots of 
enjoyment out of tinkering with the 
map, while others just need a basic idea 
of where everything is in relation to 
each other� 
Divide your map into 12 regions� They do 
not have to be of identical size� You can 
use a square or hex grid, or you can make 
them irregularly sized as you prefer� If you 
look at your map, you will probably see 
some obvious places to draw the regions 
based on features such as mountain 
ranges or rivers, which tend to be natural 
boundaries between areas� 
Soldiers from the Platoon
In some campaign circumstances, you may 
find positions in your squad temporarily 
covered by a soldier from elsewhere in 
the platoon� Normally this replacement 
will have the starting profile and no 
advancements of any kind; however, they 
may potentially earn advancements, items, 
or transformations while fighting in your 
squad� If so, you should track that this 
happened� Any time you have a member of 
the platoon join your squad temporarily, 
you may opt to have it be any soldier you 
already know�

---

## Page 67

CAMPAIGNS
65
If your map already has a grid (many 
RPG maps have hexes, for example) then 
you can make each region a few hexes 
in size depending on the overall size of 
your map� For example, if your map is 
a huge world map, you might choose to 
play out your campaign in one particular 
part of it� This can be really fun when you 
play subsequent campaigns and play in a 
different part of the world�
You do not have to fill in the entire map� 
It is fine to have some unclaimed areas 
that are not assigned to anything� These 
areas will be unpopulated wasteland 
where the campaign will not take place 
(or alternatively may be peaceful areas 
not overrun by monsters)� Only the parts 
of the map you draw regions on is part of 
the campaign�
Once you have set up your regions, make 
sure that each has a clear terrain type 
chosen from the Terrain table on this 
page� If your map is blank, you can fill it in 
as you like or you can roll on the table� If 
your map already has terrain drawn on it, 
all you need to do is to match each region 
with the most appropriate type from the 
table� If a region has multiple terrain 
types, you can either choose a dominant 
type, pick what is most interesting or adds 
the most variety, or you can roll randomly 
when you arrive there�
Example:
My map has a city in the desert. 
I decide that when I travel there, 
I will roll a D6, with 1-2 being a 
desert battle and 3-6 being a  
city battle.
In some cases, you may have to pick 
whatever is closest to an entry on the 
table� Don’t sweat it too much� The terrain 
type will add a basic terrain factor to the 
battles taking place there (see page 30)�
Terrain table
D100 Terrain type
01-15 Plains
16-30 Forest
31-40 Mountains
41-45 Desert
46-55 City
56-65 Ruins
66-70 Swamps
71-80 Wasteland
81-90 Underground
91-95 Arctic
96-00 Jungle
If you use random rolls, the mixture of 
terrain may end up feeling unrealistic� 
Some are not bothered by this (it’s a 
magic world, so of course ice tundras and 
jungles can be next to each other), but 
if it feels too weird, find a map region 
that looks out of place and swap it with a 
different location on the map� Do this the 
least number of times it takes to get the 
map to feel like it fits together� 
Adapting to Your Collection
You may find that some of these results 
require terrain you do not own at 
all� If this is the case, adapt the table 
by swapping out those results for 
something else� For example, if you do 
not have any model buildings yet, you 
might treat all rolls of ‘City’ as ‘Plains’ 
and ‘Ruins’ as ‘Forest’�

High and Low Magic
The power of magic often fluctuates with 
the land� Spell-casters pay close attention 
to such circumstances�
A high-magic region is suffused in 
magical energies, making it easier to 
draw in the residual power to fuel a 
spell� Spell-casters often feel slightly 
giddy when they are in such an area� 
High-magic regions are often vibrant, 
with strange-looking plants and crystals 
growing out of the ground�
A low-magic region, on the other hand, 
might feel dull and ashen to a person 
attuned to magical energies� Such areas 
are often rocky and grey even to the 
casual observer� They tend to make spell-
casters feel cranky and short-tempered 
as they struggle to access the powers they 
take for granted�
Select two regions on your map and 
nominate one as being high magic and 
another as being low magic� This will 
affect spell-casting when you play in that 
region by making spells easier or harder 
to cast respectively (see page 81)�
You can roll randomly to assign both 
(rerolling if you pick the same both times), 
or you may find that a particular area on 
your map looks like it should be more or 
less magical (if you identify a big faerie 
forest, that is usually a perfect place)�
If you are playing in a game world that 
you want to resemble the setting of a 
particular fantasy book or game, you can 
adjust this as you see fit�
  A high-magic world should have 
3 high-magic regions and  
1 low-magic region�
  A low-magic world should have 
3 low-magic regions and  
1 high-magic region�

Campaign Duration
The campaign lasts for a total of 12 
regular campaign turns plus a final 
battle at the end� 
Once this is at an end, Victory Points are 
tallied up to determine how successful 
you have been� You can compare your 
Victory Point total to how your friends 
have done or replay to compete against 
the same score� Victory Points also affect 
your ability to carry soldiers forward 
into a new campaign� Victory Points are 
discussed further on page 139�
Of course, points are not everything 
(and for that matter you may opt not 
to count at all)� We strongly encourage 
players to pick their own objectives as 
well: You may follow a specific character 
(represented by a favorite miniature) 
and see if they can survive the campaign� 
You might look back and see how you 
feel about what you achieved, or you may 
simply play to have a good time and blow 
up a bunch of orcs� 
It is worth thinking about your 
objectives at the beginning of the 
campaign, so you have something in 
mind, but don’t feel locked into an idea� 
You may decide that tallying Victory 
Points is not your idea of fun even if you 
started that way, or you may decide that 
you would actually like to know how 
well you did after all� If you are not sure, 
count up the Victory Points just in case, 
as it is easier to do so and not need it 
than to try and count backwards� 
If you get to the end and you had a great 
time because of that one moment when 
you shot a rocket launcher at a dragon, 
then mission accomplished�
Campaign Flow
Certain campaign turns have special 
considerations to take into account, listed 
in the table below�

Mission’ column indicate a particularly

difficult task: A Special Mission or Final 
Battle (explained fully on pages 88 and 
94 respectively)� If there is no Special 
Mission, play out a standard mission  
that turn� 
Mob Size indicates the number of figures 
in each enemy mob you place on the 
battlefield� Note that events and conditions 
can modify this number up or down�
Victory Points
Victory Points (VP) are earned as follows:
Every mission where you 
completed your Objectives
+1 VP
Every villain defeated +1 VP
Every Special Mission 
completed
+1 VP
Final Battle won +2 VP
All awards are cumulative: Completing 
the Objectives of a Special Mission 
where you defeated a villain would be a 
total of 3 VP�
You can think of your Victory Points as 
how well you have freed the area from 
evil monsters, a measure of your fame 
and fortune, or how thoroughly you 
have disrupted the enemy activities� 
It may even be a measure of all of the 
above combined� 
Additional Special Battle
If you prefer to have more variety in your 
missions, you may opt to have special 
battles happen in turns 3, 6, 9, and 12 
rather than the normal schedule of 4, 8, 
and 12�
Determine Difficulty Factors 
(optional rule)
If you wish to use any Difficulty Factors in 
your campaign, go to The Difficulty Factors 
chapter (page 26) and pick them now� You 
do not have to do this if you prefer not 
to worry about it� If you skip this step, 
everything will function as explained in 
the main game rules� This is often the best 
option for your first campaign game�

CAMPAIGN SEQUENCE
The game is played in a series of 
campaign turns, each of which can 
represent from a few days to a few 
weeks as your platoon searches for their 
comrades and tries to make a difference 
in lands overrun by evil monsters� 
Each campaign turn features a single 
tabletop battle where you will carry 
out a mission and fight the enemies 
and monsters� 
You will carry out the steps in this chapter 
at the beginning of each campaign turn� 
Follow each step, in order, until you are 
directed to move to the next chapter�
Step 1: Take a Rest (once)
Once during the campaign, you may 
opt to take a rest� The squad finds a safe 
location, settles in, and takes a few days 
to recuperate and repair their kit� This 
allows every injured soldier in your 
squad to tick off one turn of recovery� 
You then proceed with the next step 
below as normal� 
Step 2: Request Help from Allies
You are not alone in this strange land� You 
may send out a soldier to look for allies 
and aid� You may do this 3 times during 
the campaign� It is up to you when you 
wish to ask for help, but you cannot do so 
in two consecutive campaign turns� 
Roll D100 and consult the table below to 
determine what kind of help you find� 
Ally Assistance table
D100 Ally Effects
01-09 Treasure 
hunter
An old treasure hunter tells you where there is a buried chest 
of valuables��� or at least they are pretty sure that was the 
case� In the next mission, if an Investigation grants any Loot, 
roll twice the first time only, and receive both items�
10-19 Healer A kind-hearted healer restores one of your injured soldiers 
to full health� If none of your soldiers are recovering from 
injuries, the Healer will offer to come back the first time you 
do need them�
20-25 Armorsmith A talented smithy creates a custom suit of armor for you� 
This can only be worn by one soldier, chosen by you, but they 
receive a 5+ saving throw and no movement reductions� 
26-33 Scout Elven scouts reveal the enemy positions to you� In the next 
mission, a randomly selected mob begins the battle Unaware�
34-40 Raiders Dwarves raid one of the enemy camps� In the next battle, the 
enemy receives 1 less Aggression each battle round�
41-46 Teacher A scholar has much to offer, even to people from so far away�  
A grunt of your choice may be turned into a known 
personality (see page 20)�

47-55 Cleric The blessings of the gods seem like a useful thing to have�  
A random squad member gains 1 point of temporary Luck� 
Temporary Luck stays until used, but if you have both regular 
and temporary Luck, the temporary point is always used first� 
56-61 Weaponsmith A master forger offers to create you an excellent blade� This 
counts as a normal sword but adds +1 to all damage rolls� 
62-68 Worried 
villager
They say a monster is prowling these parts� If you choose 
to go after it, the enemy will have a random monster arrive 
from the middle of a neutral battlefield edge at the start 
of Round 3� If you kill the monster, you receive 3 points of 
Exposure and 2 rolls on the Loot table in addition to any 
normal rewards� 
69-77 Traveler The traveler tells you where the enemy is concentrating� If 
you choose to take them on, you will face an additional mob 
at the start of the next battle, though the extra mob begins 
Unaware� If you completely destroy at least 2 mobs, you get 
an additional Loot roll�  
78-81 Curious 
creature
A short-winged lizard tells you that it has fallen through 
space and time� You have no idea what it means but you 
may add 2 points of Exposure as you realize everything is 
possible� 
82-88 Diplomat The diplomat needs to get to somewhere and would like your 
help� If you assist them, they are added to your squad next 
mission� They carry no weapons and have the basic profile� 
They act as part of your squad� If the diplomat can exit across 
the opposing battlefield edge, you may roll for a Loot item�
On a 36" battlefield, you may roll twice and pick either of the 
two items as a reward�
89-97 Pet One of the soldiers makes a creature friend which is now 
part of your squad� They have:
Agility 2, Speed 8", Combat Skill +1, Toughness 4 
and count as a grunt with a +1 damage melee weapon for 
all game purposes� They cannot Investigate, complete 
Objectives, or use any equipment� They get an additional  
+1 Combat Skill bonus if they initiate a hand-to-hand combat�
You can use a wolf, lizard, tiger, or any other figure you like� 
They do not progress or gain experience in any way�
98-00 Mystic A strange wanderer tells you about “congealing strands from 
residual magical energies”� You wonder if they are in the 
right place, but one spell-caster in your squad may learn one 
random spell� If you do not have a spell-caster, they offer to 
come back when you do�

You may bring back the Mystic and the 
Healer if you cannot use their services 
immediately� You may do this 
whenever you like and does not 
count as an additional use of the 
ally or prevent you from using an 
ally that campaign turn�
If you encounter the same ally result 
more than once, it can be taken to be 
the exact same character, and you should 
probably name them� Some players may 
enjoy painting up a model for these 
characters, but there is no need to do so 
as they will not feature on the battlefield 
(except for the Pet, which will require a 
figure to represent it in battle)�
Allies also allow you to build out the story, 
suggesting patterns in the events you roll� 
If you keep encountering a particular 
type of ally, maybe your soldiers have 
befriended a nearby community and 
they are trying to aid you in your quest� 
Meanwhile a repeat of the same ally 
could be taken as the same character who 
has become a steady friend of the unit�
Step 3: Commit Soldiers to  
Side Tasks
You may send soldiers from your 
squad to carry out secondary tasks 
that present themselves� This prevents 
them from accompanying you 
into battle, but can result in other 
advantages being gained� 
Roll D100 twice on the Side Tasks table 
(see page 72) and pick which of the 
options you would prefer� You cannot 
select both�
The soldier that is sent cannot take 
the battlefield during this mission� 
Instead, their position will be filled  
by a grunt from the platoon� They will 
have the same military weapons as the  
soldier they are replacing and the 
starting profile but will lack any 
upgrades or Transformations� If you 
already know platoon members 
who have gained advances or 
Transformations from previously 
joining your squad, you may pick 
any one of those to fill in�

Step 4: Determine Next Battle 
Location
In the first turn of the campaign, you can 
either pick a map region at random or 
choose where you would like to begin the 
campaign� In subsequent turns, you may 
travel to any adjacent region for the next 
mission� If you have already explored 
every adjacent region, you may move to 
the nearest unexplored region�  
You can roll on the Location Draw table

PREPARE FOR BATTLE SEQUENCE 
When you undertake a mission, you must 
determine the circumstances you will be 
fighting under� Whether it is scouting the 
area, making contact with a vital person, 
or making off with something valuable, 
staying focused on your Objectives is the 
key to success� 
Follow each step, in order, to determine 
the mission details�
Step 1: Mission Requirements
If this is one of the first two turns of the 
campaign, generate a single Objective, 
skip this table, and move directly to  
Step 2� Otherwise, roll D100:
Mission Requirements table
D100 Requirements
01-40 Generate one Objective.
You must complete it to win the 
mission�
41-60 Generate two Objectives�
Both must be completed to win 
the mission� You may do so in 
any order�
61-70 Generate two Objectives.
To win the mission you must 
complete either one�
71-85 Generate two Objectives.
They both must be completed, 
and in the order you generated 
them�
86-00 Generate one Objective.
When you have completed it, 
generate a second Objective 
that must now be completed to 
win the mission�
Once you know how many Objectives you 
are generating, move to Step 2�
Optional Steps
Some of the steps listed below are 
optional� They will make the mission more 
varied and fun, but they also mean there is 
more stuff to keep track of, and the game 
becomes more complicated� It is up to 
you if you want to use these components� 
You do not have to make that decision 
for the entire campaign right now� For 
each optional step you can choose to use 
it or not as you see fit, and you may use a 
different combination of optional steps in 
the next mission�

Step 2: Mission Objectives
Roll D100 for each Objective that must be 
generated and consult the table below to 
find out what you are trying to achieve� 
Interact
Several Objectives require an Interact 
action� A soldier must be in contact 
with the terrain feature and roll a 4+ 
on 1D6+Wits to do so successfully� Only 
one attempt is permitted per feature in 
a single battle round, but attempts in 
future rounds get a +1 bonus for each 
prior failed attempt on that Objective 
(regardless of which soldier attempted it)�
Mission Objectives table
D100 Objective
01-15 Scout the Area
Randomly select two terrain features that are not within 8" of your own 
battlefield edge� A soldier must successfully Interact with each feature� Once 
both features are scouted, the Objective is complete�
16-30 Investigate the Area
You must Interact successfully with the terrain feature closest to the center of 
the battlefield� If you succeed, the Objective is completed� If you fail, you must 
complete a “Scout the Area” Objective instead�
31-40 Advance through the Area
Assign any number of your soldiers to carry cargo� Soldiers carrying cargo 
cannot Dash, but can otherwise fight normally� At least two soldiers must exit 
across the opposing battlefield edge to complete the mission�
If a soldier becomes a casualty, they drop their cargo and another soldier can 
pick it up by moving into contact and taking an Action� A soldier can carry 
only a single cargo at a time�
41-55 Retrieve Something
Randomly select one terrain feature that is not within 8" of your battlefield 
edge� A soldier must Interact with the terrain feature� If they succeed, they 
pick up the valuable item and must now move it to their starting battlefield 
edge to complete the mission�
If the interaction fails, the nearest enemy figure has the item� That unit will 
now focus on trying to move off the enemy battlefield edge, which causes the 
mission to fail�
An item carrier that becomes a casualty will drop it on the ground� The enemy 
will not pick up the item once it has been dropped�
Duplicate Objectives
If you roll the same Objective twice you 
may choose to reroll one� If so, the new 
roll stands, even if it is the same� A second 
“Hold Off the Enemy” Objective is treated 
as no Objective�

56-70 Interact with Something
Randomly select one terrain feature that is not within 8" of your battlefield 
edge� A soldier must Interact with the terrain feature� Each failed attempt 
generates 2 points of Aggression immediately� Once you have successfully 
interacted, the Objective is completed�
71-80 Hold off the Enemy
You must fight for 5 rounds� At the end of each battle round from 5 onwards, 
if no enemy figures are on your side of the table or once the number of 
enemies killed or removed due to Morale reaches 20, you complete this 
mission� Monsters count as half their Monster Point score, rounded up� For 
example, a monster with 6 MP counts as 3 figures�
If this Objective is generated during the mission, the round count begins at 
that point, but kills are counted from the beginning�
81-90 Capture a High-value Target*
Randomly select an enemy figure that is carrying a valuable bit of intel� If you 
kill them in hand-to-hand combat, you can pick up the intel automatically� 
Otherwise, it is dropped when they die or flee due to a Morale check, and you 
must move to pick it up� Once you have the intel you complete the Objective 
by moving to your starting battlefield edge� The enemy will not pick up 
dropped intel�
91-00 Eliminate a High-value Target*
The target is not revealed until the first Aggression table roll� After placing 
any additional troops required by the Aggression table, randomly select 
a champion or monster currently on the table (and any random figure, if 
neither are available)� The target must be killed to complete the Objective� If 
this Objective is generated during a battle mission, the target is not revealed 
until the next Aggression roll�
In Campaign Turns 1 and 2, select from the initial enemies deployed�
*High-value targets are always Fearless and unaffected by Morale dice�

Step 3: Support 
While the world is big and the enemies 
are many, no soldier fights alone� You 
are part of a military force and can draw 
upon help during your battles�
Support is acquired through Support 
Points� If you completed the Field 
Exercises, you begin with 2 Support 
Points; otherwise, you will begin with 0 
Support Points for your first mission� You 
receive Support Points after each mission 
as well as from a range of other events 
and options�
You may expend Support Points to buy 
rolls on the Support table below� Each 
point buys one roll� You may spend 
multiple points to roll additional times 
with each point buying one attempt� Any 
duplicate results are ignored, and the 
points are spent� You cannot spend more 
points after rolling� 
For example, if you pay 3 Support 
Points, and roll “Fire Support” twice 
and “Planning Support” once, you would 
receive both types of Support and still pay 
a final cost of 3 points�
You are not required to take Support at 
all if you want to save up your points for 
later, but once you have rolled the dice, 
the points are spent�
Support table
D100 Support
01-40 Fire support
41-50 Sniper support
51-65 Logistical support
66-80 Planning support
81-90 Platoon sergeant
91-00 Platoon leader
Fire Support
You will have fire support during the 
mission (see page 47)� 
Sniper Support
You will be accompanied by a sniper� 
Three times during the battle, when one of 
your soldiers is acting, you may have the 
sniper take a shot as well� You cannot take 
more than one sniper shot in the same 
battle round� This can be resolved before

or after (but not during) the actions of 
the soldier that is currently active, and 
the target must be visible to the soldier� 
Snipers may target any figure in a mob as 
long as it is within Line of Sight�
Snipers Hit automatically with +1 damage 
and negate saving throws�
Logistical Support
You receive 3 loads of additional 
ammunition for this battle� They do not 
have to be assigned to a specific character� 
Any soldier can use a load of ammo as a 
Free Action and may roll two additional 
shots when firing� Does not apply when 
attacking with explosives�
Planning Support
Due to superior intel and planning, you 
have gained an advantage over the enemy� 
When you have fully deployed, you may 
select one enemy mob that begins the 
game Unaware� 
Platoon Sergeant
The platoon sergeant accompanies you 
for this mission and is deployed as part of 
your squad� You may use two leadership 
tactics this mission, but you cannot use 
the same Tactic twice�
Platoon Leader
The lieutenant decides to tag along for 
this mission and is deployed as part of 
your squad�
The platoon leader always has the 
Leadership skill� 
Step 4: Terrain Set-up
The setup of table terrain is an important 
element of the game� In general, it is 
better to make your battlefield fairly 
dense with terrain for the figures to 
move around and through, giving them 
interesting tactical options; in such 
terrain, your soldiers can move to keep 
enemies in or out of sight or try to funnel 
the villains in particular directions� 
The terrain you select should loosely 
match the region you are playing in� For 
example, if you are playing in a forest 
region, you should have lots of trees and 
woodland features on your gaming table� 
If in doubt, try to have roughly half the 
terrain match the region� Of course, you 
can always be creative, such as having a 
village within a forest� 
We have opted not to provide exact 
terrain types due to the huge variety 
possible, allowing you to play using 
as wide a collection as possible� What 
matters in play are the types of terrain 
discussed previously: Linear, Individual, 
Area, Field, Block, and Interior�
You can build a table in whatever manner 
you like, though if you prefer a more 
systematic approach, you can use the 
table provided below� 
Begin by dividing the play area into 
roughly 1'x1' squares� A typical 3'x3' 
battlefield would create 9 squares� For 
each square, roll 1D6 on each of the two 
tables below:
D6 Terrain
1 1 Large (5"-8") Block
2 1 Large (5"-8") Field
3 1 Large (5"-8") Area or Interior
4 2 Medium (2"-5") Blocks or Areas
5 2 Medium (2"-5") Areas
6 1 Medium (2"-5") Block or Area

---

## Page 81

CAMPAIGNS
79
D6 Terrain
1 2 Medium (2"-5") Blocks or Areas
2 2 Medium (2"-5") Blocks or 
Areas, plus 2 Linear
3 3 Linear pieces
4 1 Medium (2"-5") Block or Area, 
plus 1 cluster of scatter terrain�
5 1 Medium (2"-5") Block or Area, 
plus 1 Linear
6 Cluster of Individual terrain
  Area features are usually forest or 
similar�
  Blocks are usually boulders or 
otherwise impassable terrain�
  Linear features are usually fences, 
hedges, or walls, 4-6" long�
  Individual terrain here means a 
handful of individual features, such 
as 4-6 small boulders or single trees�
When you know what you need, pick 
out suitable pieces from your collection� 
Don’t fret if you don’t have exactly the 
right thing, as substituting will be fine� As 
you populate the table, try to put similar 
options near each other� For example, if 
you have a whole bunch of big rocks, try 
putting them near each other while you 
put all the huts and houses on the other 
side of the table�
If you would like to use a large 
centerpiece such as a wizard’s tower or a 
huge demonic portal, try to put it near the 
center of the battlefield� If you put it out 
on the sides, it is unlikely to feature much 
in the game at all� Of course, you may 
enjoy the look of fighting near a wizard’s 
tower instead of around it!
Once you have filled your table with 
terrain, grab a handful of what we call 
“scatter” – single trees, bushes, small 
rocks, and so forth – and put them 
around the table to enhance the look or 
fill in a few gaps� For visual appeal, a few 
tufts of flock can be put around the table�

Region Terrain Rules (optional)
The type of terrain present in the region 
will add a special condition to the battle 
as indicated below� You may omit this 
rule if you prefer to simplify gameplay a 
little bit�
Arctic
The intense cold drains your energy� Any 
soldier that becomes a casualty and needs 
to recover from injuries must recover for 
one additional campaign turn� 
City
A city’s back alleys represent an 
unpredictable environment to fight in, 
but you may be able to take advantage 
of this� All initially deployed enemies 
begin the battle Unaware� Place an 
additional Investigation in the center of 
the battlefield�
Desert
The intense heat prevents any soldier 
carrying a squad automatic, anti-tank 
weapon, or grenade launcher from taking 
the Dash action� 
Forest
As the area is heavily overgrown, visibility 
is limited to 16" maximum� 
Jungle
In the thickets, it can be difficult for both 
sides to identify their targets� All attacks 
against targets more than 8" away grant a 
6+ saving throw to the target�
Mountains
There are a lot of rocks and boulders to 
hide behind� Any figure in Cover from a 
ranged attack receives a 6+ saving throw� 
The normal rules apply for figures with 
more than one saving throw�
Plains
Open spaces with good Lines of Sight�  
No special rules apply�
Ruins
Ruins often contain valuables: At the 
end of the mission, if you completed any 
Investigations, you receive one additional 
Loot roll (not one per Investigation)� 
You must add +1 every time you roll for 
Aggression during the mission as the 
place is no doubt crawling with foes�
Swamps
The ground is a thick mire� All movement 
speeds are reduced by 1" if the figure 
begins the move on the battlefield surface� 
Figures on raised terrain features, such as 
the roof of a building, are not hindered� 
This affects both friends and enemies, but 
figures with wings are unaffected� 
Underground
The battle takes place within a cave or 
a series of caves� Visibility is limited to 
8" due to the darkness� Fire support is 
impossible, and any such result is treated 
as no support� 
Wasteland
The deep wilderness is quite isolating, 
and you may be able to complete the 
mission without attracting too many 
enemies� Every time you roll for 
Aggression apply a -1 modifier to the 
die roll�

Magic Influence
High Magic
  In a high-magic region, spell-casters 
always receive 1 more point of Power 
than the Initiative die they were 
assigned: For example, if the die 
assigned was a 3, you receive 4 Power�
  Enemy spell-casters add +1 to Hit 
when making a magical attack�
Low Magic
  In a low-magic region, spell-casters 
always receive 1 less point of Power 
than the Initiative die they were 
assigned (minimum 0)�
  Enemy spell-casters roll 1D6 each 
time they cast a spell or make a 
magical attack� On a 1, the spell fails 
to work�
Special Terrain (flavor option)
Who knew what was coming next? 
Something horrible probably. 
This place, the Ruin they called it, 
this was a truly terrible place. 
One star. Would not recommend.
– Forgotten Ruin
If you enjoy a more whimsical approach 
to your gaming table or like having some 
prompts for what to build next, you can 
roll on the Special Terrain table� This has 
a collection of interesting features that 
you can add to any gaming table� They 
do not directly affect gameplay and are 
primarily meant as inspiration, though 
they are a prime opportunity to concoct a 
scenario special rule or ability� 
As an easy option, place the special 
terrain where an Objective or 
Investigation is placed to make it look 
more interesting and help tell the story of 
your battle�
Special Terrain table
D100 Terrain
01-05 A group of statues 
06-11 Giant crystals
12-17 Giant mushrooms
18-22 Crater or pit
23-27 Obelisk or standing stones
28-31 Tower 
32-35 Small garden
36-40 Strange pond
41-46 Broken statue
47-50 Monster skeleton
51-55 Giant plants
56-61 Site of an old battle

71-74 Beast lair
75-80 Burned down building
81-85 Painted stone
86-91 Strange tree
92-95 Harmless ghost
96-00 Strange flowers
If you do want the feature to have some 
small game impact, roll 1D6 upon 
reaching a special terrain feature for the 
first time in a mission:
  On a 1, increase Aggression by +2 
immediately� 
  On a 2-4, it has no effect�
  On a 5-6, you earn 1 point of 
Exposure� 
The special terrain only ever has that 
effect once�

Step 5: Place Investigations
Place 4 Investigation markers on the 
battlefield� Each is placed halfway 
between the battlefield center and 
the center of a battlefield edge� These 
represent points of interest that you 
will want to search during the battle� 
See page 86 for explanations of how 
these work�
You can use any suitable token or marker, 
but the game looks more interesting if 
you use crystals, tombstones, statues, 
a tiny creature figure, or something 
similarly interesting to look at� If 
you have nothing at hand, pick a few 
interesting pebbles from the yard or take 
a couple of spare miniatures and paint 
them grey to look like statues�
Step 6: Assign Battlefield Edges 
and Deploy
Roll 1D6 and add the Wits score of the 
highest-ranking soldier you have with 
you on the mission (even if a lower-
ranking soldier would be better): 
On a roll of 6 or better, you may choose 
which battlefield edge you will begin on� 
On a score of 5 or lower, you must select 
randomly (if you have particular seating 
arrangements just pick randomly from 
the battlefield edges you can actually sit 
at)� The enemy will always deploy from 
the battlefield edge opposite yours�
Set up your soldiers along your own 
battlefield edge, up to 3" onto the table 
if your table is 24" across, or 6" onto the 
table if your table is 36" across or more� 
You may set up as you like, with fire teams 
being set up together or spread out as you 
see fit�
If your squad is accompanied by anyone 
such as the platoon leader, set them up 
normally at this stage as well�

Step 7: Battle Conditions 
(optional) 
This step is optional� Battle conditions 
are additional factors that apply to a 
mission� Think of them as a mission 
modifier that can make the mission 
easier or more difficult� You can decide 
whether you want to use this for any 
given mission, but once you roll the dice, 
you must apply the result�
If you wish to use this rule, roll D100 on 
the table below� The result applies for the 
duration of the battle� Modifiers to factors 
are generally cumulative�
Battle Conditions table
D100 Battle Condition
01-05 Low visibility
Visibility is reduced to 8"� If 
the battle has multiple sources 
of reduced visibility, use the 
single lowest score�
06-10 Medium visibility
Visibility is reduced to 12"� If 
the battle has multiple sources 
of reduced visibility, use the 
single lowest score�
11-15 Weak magical winds
All Resistance rolls against 
spells are +1�
16-20 Strong magical winds
All Resistance rolls against 
spells are -1�
21-25 Reduced enemy attention
When rolling for Aggression 
increase each round, reduce 
the die roll by 1�
26-30 High alert
The enemy begins the battle 
with 3 points of Aggression�
D100 Battle Condition
31-35 Low alert
A random enemy mob that 
would normally begin Aware 
instead begins the battle 
Unaware�
36-40 Fewer foes
All enemy mob sizes are 
reduced by 1 for the duration of 
the battle�
41-45 Easy investigations
Add +1 to all Investigation rolls�
46-50 Vital Objective
A randomly selected 
Objective grants 1 Story Point 
immediately upon completion� 
51-55 Quick entry
Each of your soldiers may take 
two moves in Round 1� Only 
the second move is counted for 
the purposes of weapons fire, so 
a soldier that moves once, then 
remains stationary, will fire as 
if they were stationary�
56-60 Surrounded
Deploy the first 3 enemy mobs, 
with one at the center of each 
battlefield edge you are not 
deploying from� Any additional 
enemies as well as any units 
that arrive from the “enemy 
battlefield edge” randomly 
pick one of the three edges to 
arrive from�

## Page 86

CAMPAIGNS

D100 Battle Condition
61-65 Independent monster
Randomly determine a 
monster and place it in the 
center of the battlefield� 
The monster moves at the 
beginning of each Enemy Phase 
and will attack whichever 
figures are nearest, regardless 
of size� The enemy will attack 
it normally if it is the closest 
target� If enemy monsters 
are present, they and the 
independent monster will 
always target each other in 
preference to other targets� 
The independent monster can 
summon more monsters by 
Roaring normally� These will 
also be Independent�
66-70 Low on supplies
You may only throw grenades 
twice in the game� 
71-75 Loot cache
A random Objective awards an 
extra Loot roll after the battle, 
if you complete it�
D100 Battle Condition
76-80 Opportunity
All initial enemy mobs reduce 
their size by 2 figures, but 
any mobs that arrive due to 
Aggression rolls will have an 
additional figure�
81-85 Cautious entry
In Round 1, only soldiers 
activating in the Fast Actions 
Phase can Move or Dash, 
though other actions are 
permitted normally�
86-90 Nervous foes
Any time a mob tests Morale, 
roll one additional die� This 
has no effect on foes that do not 
normally test for Morale�
91-95 Villainous attention
After rolling for villains 
normally (see page 104), if any 
villains remain on your roster 
and are not present for the 
battle, a randomly selected 
villain shows up as part of the 
enemy force� 
This has no effect if you do not 
know any villains�
96-00 High-value Objective
A randomly selected Objective 
grants 1 Victory Point upon 
completion�

Step 8: Determine Personal Task 
(optional)
This step is optional, and you may want to 
omit it the first couple of times you play 
in order to keep the game simpler�
A personal task is something that one of 
your soldiers must attempt to achieve�  
If you wish to use personal tasks, 
randomly select a soldier from among 
those deployed in the mission, then 
roll on the table above� If the soldier 
successfully performs the task during the 
mission, you receive 1 Story Point� 
If you don’t mind keeping track, you 
can allow personal tasks to remain 
until they are completed, but 
a given soldier can only 
have one at a time� If your 
random selection is a 
soldier that already has 
an unfinished task, you 
may keep the original 
task or drop it for the 
new one, but you cannot 
take both�
Ready for Battle
You are now ready to fight! Go to 
Chapter 5: The Enemy (page 97) to

INVESTIGATIONS
The mission area is often full of 
unexpected sights that are worth checking 
out� You may insist on sweeping these 
for possible benefits and rewards or you 
may stay well clear to avoid more trouble� 
When you set up your mission you also 
place a number of Investigations around 
the table (see page 82)�
The enemy ignores Investigations when 
they move, and cannot interact with them 
in any way unless a rule specifically states 
otherwise� Investigation markers do not 
exist in the game world, so they do not 
inhibit movement, provide Cover, prevent 
Line of Sight, or interfere with any other 
game function�
Your soldiers can check out an 
Investigation by ending a move within 1" 
of the marker� They do not have to touch 
it or spend an action; simply to move 
within range is enough� Immediately 
upon completing that move, roll 
1D6+Wits for that soldier:
D6+Wits Investigation
1-3 Search required
Place the die you just rolled 
next to the Investigations marker 
with the rolled result showing�
At the end of each battle round, if at least one soldier (which can be 
different from the one that uncovered the marker) is within 1" of the 
Investigations marker, increase the die face by +1� Note that an Action is 
not required to increase the score by one, just that a soldier is within range 
at the end of the battle round�
Once it is a 4 or greater, the Investigation is revealed: Roll D100 on the 
Investigation Outcome table�
4+ Reveal
Roll D100 on the Investigation Outcome table to see what you have found�

01-25 Exposure
You are exposed to mystical energies.
Add +1 point of Exposure to your total� If this brings your total to 3 or more 
points, you must immediately pay for and roll for Transformation (see 
page 133) for the soldier investigating the marker� If the soldier is already 
Transformed, the Exposure is added to your campaign total, but you may 
choose to buy an upgrade for that soldier immediately if you now have 
enough points�
Increase the Aggression score by +1 immediately�
26-40 Tactical insight
You have gained a valuable insight in how to fight in this strange world or 
found a unique opportunity to influence the battle.
You may use one additional Leadership Tactic this battle, though you may 
not duplicate any previously used Tactic�
41-50 Loot
Someone buried something interesting here.
A soldier must spend an Action to dig it up� Roll on the Loot table; the soldier 
in question can use the item right away�
Increase the Aggression score by +2 immediately�
51-80 Some useful bits
You may add +2 Kit Points after the mission�
81-00 Something bad is happening.
The bad guys are up to something, and you have stepped into a trap.
Count the remaining Objectives and Investigations and pick one of them at 
random� The selected target will generate 1 additional point of Aggression 
every battle round until it has been completed or otherwise removed from 
the battlefield�

SPECIAL MISSIONS
There will be a total of three Special 
Missions during campaign turns 4, 8, 
and 12 (optionally 3, 6, 9, and 12 instead)� 
These are modified from the normal 
missions you will undertake and use a 
modified setup sequence�

01-05 Scout the Area
Randomly select two terrain features that are not within 8" of your own 
battlefield edge� A soldier must successfully Interact with each feature� Once 
both features are scouted, the Objective is complete�
06-10 Investigate the Area
You must Interact successfully with the terrain feature closest to the center of 
the battlefield� If you succeed, the Objective is completed� If you fail, you must 
complete a “Scout the Area” Objective instead�
11-20 Advance through the Area
Assign any number of your soldiers to carry cargo� Soldiers carrying cargo 
cannot Dash, but can otherwise fight normally� At least two soldiers must exit 
across the opposing battlefield edge to complete the mission�
If a soldier becomes a casualty, they drop their cargo and another soldier can 
pick it up by moving into contact and taking an Action� A soldier can carry 
only a single cargo at a time�
21-40 Retrieve Something
Randomly select one terrain feature that is not within 8" of your battlefield 
edge� A soldier must Interact with the terrain feature� If they succeed, they 
pick up the valuable item and must now move it to their starting battlefield 
edge to complete the mission�
If the interaction fails, the nearest enemy figure has the item� That unit will 
now focus on trying to move off the enemy battlefield edge, which causes the 
mission to fail�
An item carrier that becomes a casualty will drop it on the ground� The enemy 
will not pick up the item once it has been dropped�
41-50 Interact with Something
Randomly select one terrain feature that is not within 8" of your battlefield 
edge� A soldier must Interact with the terrain feature� Each failed attempt 
generates 2 points of Aggression immediately� Once you have successfully 
interacted, the Objective is completed�
51-65 Hold off the Enemy
You must fight for 5 rounds� At the end of each battle round from 5 onwards, 
if no enemy figures are on your side of the table or once the number of 
enemies killed or removed due to Morale reaches 20, you complete this 
mission� Monsters count as half their Monster Point score, rounded up� For 
example, a monster with 6 MP counts as 3 figures�
If this Objective is generated during the mission, the round count begins at 
that point, but kills are counted from the beginning�

Randomly select an enemy figure that is carrying a valuable bit of intel� If you 
kill them in hand-to-hand combat, you can pick up the intel automatically� 
Otherwise, it is dropped when they die or flee due to a Morale check, and you 
must move to pick it up� Once you have the intel you complete the Objective 
by moving to your starting battlefield edge� The enemy will not pick up 
dropped intel�
81-00 Eliminate a High-value Target*
The target is not revealed until the first Aggression table roll� After placing 
any additional troops required by the Aggression table, randomly select 
a champion or monster currently on the table (and any random figure, if 
neither are available)� The target must be killed to complete the Objective� If 
this Objective is generated during a battle mission, the target is not revealed 
until the next Aggression roll�
In Campaign Turns 1 and 2, select from the initial enemies deployed�
*High-value targets are always Fearless and unaffected by Morale dice�

Step 3: Support
Support functions exactly as in a regular 
mission� 
Step 4: Terrain Setup
All terrain setup and rules work exactly as 
in a regular mission�
Step 5: Place Investigations
There are no Investigations in a Special 
Mission, so skip this step� 
Step 6: Determine Special 
Mission Conditions
Roll D100 on the Special Missions 
Conditions table to determine the type 
of conditions for this Special Mission� If 
you roll a result you have had previously 
in this campaign, roll again (each Special 
Mission should be unique)� 
Special Mission Conditions table
D100 Condition
01-10 Enemies closing in!
The squad deploys as they see fit within 6" of the center of the battlefield�
Each enemy mob is placed at the center of a different, randomly selected 
battlefield edge� Enemies arriving during the battle arrive from a random 
battlefield edge as well�
11-20 We are getting rushed!
The enemy generates 2 additional points of Aggression each game round, but 
cease collecting any points after the third roll on the Aggression table�
21-30 We’ve detected an isolated advance guard!
The enemy begins with one additional mob and all mob sizes are increased 
by +1; however, the enemy receives no points of Aggression in this battle�
31-40 Patrol contact!
You can deploy no more than 5 soldiers from your squad this battle (before 
support is generated)� The enemy receives 1 less Aggression per round�
41-50 Enemy encampment!
All initial enemies are set up within 8" of the center of the battlefield, spread 
fairly evenly, and are set up first� You may have your soldiers deploy within 3" 
of any battlefield edge, spread out as you see fit�
During Round 1, no enemies may move, but they may shoot if eligible�
51-60 Uncertain Objectives!
At the end of each battle round, one Objective that is marked on the 
battlefield is moved 6" in a random direction� If the Objective is in a terrain 
feature, the feature moves as well!
If none of your Objectives are battlefield-oriented, reroll one Objective until 
you have at least one�

D100 Condition
61-70 Traps!
Before deploying either side, scatter 20 markers around the battlefield fairly 
evenly� 
Any figure that moves within 1" of one of these trap markers rolls 1D6: On a 
1-2, nothing happens� On a 3-6, they immediately take a +0 damage Hit� In 
both cases, the marker is removed�
Enemy mobs that do not have a champion will set off traps if they cross them 
and will take no special precautions to avoid them�
71-80 Sleeping monster!
Randomly generate a monster and place it D10" from the center of the 
battlefield� The creature is inactive/resting/drunk/asleep� The enemy will 
refuse to move within 3" of it� If you approach within 3", or a gunshot passes 
within 2", or the creature is struck, it wakes up and joins the enemy� 
If you do kill it, you receive an extra Loot roll after the battle�
81-90 Treasure trove!
Put 6 markers in a circle around the center of the battlefield, each about 
12" from the center point� When a soldier moves into contact with a marker, 
remove it and roll 1D6+Wits� On a 6+ you receive a Loot roll (usable 
immediately, if you like) and generate 3 points of Aggression� On any other 
score, nothing happens�
91-00 They are coming in groups!
It takes 15 points of Aggression to trigger a roll on the Aggression table  
(see page 34), but once reached, make two rolls and apply both�
Step 7: Assign Battlefield Edges 
and Deploy
This functions exactly as a regular 
mission except where modified by the 
Special Mission condition�
Step 8: Battle Conditions
Skip this step for Special

FINAL BATTLES
You have come this far braving evil 
sorcerers and perhaps the occasional 
dragon� Your soldiers have seen more 
than they ever expected, and some have 
lived to tell the tale� You have finally 
gotten a lead on where the rest of your 
comrades landed, but between you and 
them lies a pit of hell and despair�  As 
you check your weapons, the enemy is 
massing for one final confrontation� 
This time, there are no tricks and no 
clever ploys: It is a pitched battle against 
the hordes of darkness, and they don’t 
seem inclined towards a peaceful 
solution�
Prepping the Final Battle
The Location
The final battle will take place in a 
randomly selected region other than the 
one you are currently in� You are welcome 
to pick one that seems particularly fitting 
if you have a story or vision in mind� 
The Journey
You have some time to reflect and 
regroup as you travel to the final 
destination, as well as seek help from 
sympathetic spell casters�
You may select any two soldiers 
recovering from injuries and have them 
recover completely, regardless of how 
many turns of recovery they had left�
The Arrival
You arrive in the region near where you 
undertook a mission not so long ago, 
but the area is unrecognizable: The trees 
are withered and worn, any structures 
have crumbled into ruins and a number 
of black stone towers stand over it, 
festooned with crimson banners� 
An old druid who has been leading 
you here explains that the enemy is 
well entrenched but that there are also 
powerful artifacts within the structures� 
It is up to you whether you want to hunt 
for the artifacts or plunge straight into the 
enemy fortress�
The Artifacts
You may seek out up to three artifacts 
here: The Ring of Spell-casting, the 
Sword of Destruction, and the Staff of 
Disintegration� You can decide to go after 
one, two, or all three, and you don’t have 
to decide how many you want to pursue 
up front�
Once you opt to go to the final battle, 
you cannot come back and select an 
artifact, however� 
The Artifact Battles
Each artifact battle is a pitched battle�
Set-up:
  The two sides set up on a 3'x3' 
battlefield with a minimum of 24" 
between the two forces� 
  The terrain should be fairly 
cluttered, with statues, pillars, 
rubble, and other debris everywhere� 
The Enemy:
  Your opposition will consist of three 
mobs each consisting of 7 figures +  
1 champion� Randomly select  
them from the encounter table  
(see page 103) to see what you are 
facing in each artifact battle�

---

## Page 97

Final Battles
95
  Each mob will roll on the Mob 
Training table (see page 103)� 
  Additionally, each enemy force will 
include one randomly generated 
monster (see page 107)� The monster 
does not act in the first two turns of 
the battle, unless fired upon� 
You may generate the enemy mob 
types and monster for each artifact 
battle first, before deciding whether 
to pursue them or not�
Mission Objective:
  At the center of the opposing 
battlefield edge is a treasure chest 
containing the artifact� If a soldier 
can reach this, you can claim the 
artifact� The mission ends when you 
have left across the initial battlefield 
edge you deployed near or when you 
have destroyed every enemy� 
  There are no Objectives or 
Investigations, and no Aggression 
rolls are made�
Artifact battles allow progression and 
recovery after each of them, but you do 
not receive any Victory Points�
The Artifacts Themselves
The Ring of Spell-casting
This can be worn by any character capable 
of casting spells� It adds +1 to the Power 
score of the character each battle round� 
The Sword of Destruction
This magical melee weapon grants +3 / +3 
to Hit and damage� 
The Staff of Disintegration
This is a single-use item� It projects a 
line 12" long and 1" wide� Any figure in 
the path is killed with no saving throws 
(if one of your soldiers gets in the path 
they disappear forever)� Terrain is 
destroyed if struck by the beam, with 
larger features collapsing into rubble� 
Monsters take 1D6 Monster Points of 
damage automatically�

## Page 98

Final Battles
96
The Final Battle
Once you have completed all three artifact 
battles or have decided to not pursue any 
more, you take on the final battle, and 
there will be no more campaign turns� 
This is another pitched battle� No 
Objectives or Investigations are placed� 
You do not roll for Aggression� There is  
no mission here other than to kill or  
be killed�
Set-up
  The battlefield should leave at 
least 30" between the two  
opposing forces� 
  You may deploy your squad as 
normal, as well as a full second 
squad� The second squad has the 
standard starting weapons and basic 
profiles� They do not feature any 
advances of any kind� Any remaining 
members of the platoon including 
any characters who have advanced 
while fighting in your squad are 
assumed to be on rear guard duty�
The Enemy
The opposing force will be tremendous: 
  You will face a total of 6 mobs:
 • 3x 8 figures, all warriors� 
• 3x 7 figures, each with a champion
 These will roll on the Mob Training 
table�
  The enemy should be deployed in 
two lines with the warriors in the 
front row and the second row 4" 
behind them�
  The enemy will not test for morale� 
This is a fight to the death�
Do not leave any resource untapped�  
You win this mission if you have any 
soldier standing at the end and every 
enemy is dead� Regardless of the 
outcome, proceed to the Campaign End 
section (see page 139)�

GENERATING THE ENEMY
I saw everything.
Every heaving orc. Every angry giant. Every evil troll. Every raging ogre. The little dog 
dragon things that were constant harriers. The wicked centaurs firing their poison 
arrows. The shadow riders in black, with probably nothing more than bones beneath 
those ragged shrouds and shadowy hoods.
– Forgotten Ruin
This chapter explains how to generate the 
opposition of a given mission� Follow each 
step, in turn, and you will have a horde of 
monsters to fight against in no time� 
Step 1: Determine Enemy Type
Roll D100 on the Enemy Encounter table 
below to determine what type of enemy 
you are fighting� This will provide you 
with their basic combat profile as well as 
any special rules that apply�
Please note that the enemies are not 
intended to be equally dangerous: Some 
are more dangerous to face while others 
will be relatively weak� Also note that 
since there are more enemy types than 
there are campaign turns you 
will not encounter every type� 
This helps keep the campaigns 
unpredictable� 
What’s in a Name?
You may not have the exact miniatures 
the game calls for, or you may have a 
really cool set of figures you would like 
to use but which are not represented on 
the encounter table� You can always swap 
out the figures for something different� 
As long as you keep the same profile and 
rules, nothing will be amiss� For example, 
you have a boatload of fantasy Vikings 
and would like to use them, but you rolled 
up orcs� No problem, just place Vikings 
instead of the orcs, but use the same 
values� If you have to slightly change a 
special rule to fit better, this is usually 
no problem at all either: Try to swap 
advantageous rules for another advantage 
and swap flaws for another flaw�
If you want to adjust the profile, 
raising one value and lowering 
another is usually fine, but be 
careful about enemies 
with profiles at the 
extreme ends of the 
spectrum� An enemy 
with +3 Combat Skill 
and very high Speed will 
probably be extremely 
dangerous and a 
Toughness 6 is rarely 
fun for regular 
enemy grunts�
We’ve Been Here Before
If you are returning to a region, 
you have previously fought in, 
the enemy type will always 
be the same as it was the first 
time� If you don’t remember 
what it was, you can pick 
any prior type you like� 
Of course, if you prefer, 
you can just roll again�

D100 Enemy Speed Combat Skill Toughness Resistance Champion
01-05 Kobolds 5" +0 3 +0  5+ *
Diminutive humanoids with both canine and reptilian features.
Traps: In each of the Quick and Slow Phases, the first soldier to move within 
8" of a kobold at any point of their move must roll 1D6� On a 1-2, they step in 
a trap and are Knocked Down� They can take no other actions during that 
activation but can act normally in future rounds� 
06-10 Goblins 5" +0 3 +0  5+ *
Renowned for their cruelty, goblins are not fond of hand-to-hand combat.
Hail of arrows: When setting up, goblins receive 2 archer mobs instead of 2 
warrior mobs� The third is rolled randomly�
11-15 Orcs 5" +0 3 +0  4+ / 6+ *
Burly humanoids with a war-like demeanor
War Rage: Orcs are prone to bubbling over with aggression� At the start of the 
Enemy Phase, randomly select an orc mob� It must move at top speed towards 
the nearest soldiers to engage them in hand-to-hand combat� The orcs will not 
care about Cover, but have +1 Combat Skill for the rest of this phase�
16-20 Lizardfolk 5" +0 4 +0  5+ *
Tough reptilian humanoids clad in scaly armor
Tough hide: Lizardfolk receive a 6+ saving throw against all combat damage, 
but not against spells�

Elven warriors sworn to dark gods of pain and murder
Elite archers: Elf archer mobs may reroll 2 missed shots each time they 
shoot�
26-30 Skeletons 4" +0 3 +0 6+
It’s like something out of an old adventure film.
Traits: Fearless, Undead�
Fragile: A soldier rolling a natural 6 on the hand-to-hand combat roll will 
destroy a skeleton without needing to roll against Toughness� This negates any 
potential saving throws�
31-35 Zombies ** 4" +0 4 +0 NA
You all know these guys. Aim high. 
Traits: Fearless, Undead�
Shambling: If zombies encounter any obstacle while moving, they must halt 
but can then move across it without penalty next time they are activated� 
Hordes: At the end of each battle round, randomly select a zombie mob and 
add one additional figure to it�

46-50 Spiders ** 5" +1 4 +0 NA
Horrible eight-legged creatures with fangs that drip venom.
Skitter: Spiders do not suffer any movement reductions due to terrain�

Like the good variety but far meaner.
Stubborn: Dwarves cannot be Knocked Down for any reason�
Crossbows: Dwarf archery attacks add +1 damage�
56-60 Hobgoblins 5" +0 4 +0  3+ / 5+*
Taller than other goblinoids, hobgoblins fancy themselves professional 
soldiers.

61-65 Evil humans 5" +0 3 +0  4+ / 6+ *
Clad in strange robes and armed with weapons engraved with dark runes.

Half-animal tribes folk with a warlike demeanor. 
Throwing weapons: Each beast folk that moves into hand-to-hand combat 
when active will hurl a throwing weapon at the target before moving� This 
Hits on a natural 6 only and is resolved like an archery attack� If their target 
is removed, they may attempt to charge a different soldier but cannot throw 
another weapon this action�
71-75 Constructs ** 4" +1 5 +1 NA
Magical statues, suits of armor, or similar creations.

81-85 Cultists 5" +0 3 +0  3+ *
Despicable fools in league with the dark powers. 
Chanting: During each Aggression Phase, count the number of cultists on 
the table, then roll 3D6� If the roll is equal to or below the number, the enemy 
receives Aggression points equal to the lowest of the three dice�
86-90 Walking plants 4" +0 4 +0 NA
Mobile and hostile plants attacking with spiked tendrils. 
Traits: Fearless�
Difficult to destroy: When killed, place a marker at that location, or place 
the figure lying down� A soldier moving into contact with a “dead” plant can 
destroy it as a Free Action (in which case, remove the marker/figure)� At the 
end of each battle round, roll 1D6 for each marker� Every 1 is recovered, and 
the plant becomes active again� Lone plants form a mob on their own unless 
they are within 2" of a figure in an existing mob�
91-95 Giant bugs ** 5" +1 3 +0 NA
Entirely too many legs and entirely too large.
Chitinous shells: 6+ saving throw�

Fierce lizards prowling for anything edible, including soldiers!
Huge fangs: They bite for +1 damage�
*    See ‘Sorceror Champions’ boxout, 
page 102�
**  This unit cannot ever be an archer� 
Other foes can be archers even if it 
seems strange� This might indicate 
shooting spikes, spitting acid, or 
magical darts� 
Fearless: The unit is not subject to Morale 
tests for any reason�
Undead: Any items or abilities that have 
special effects against Undead apply� 
Enemy characters have a profile just like 
your soldiers, though it differs slightly:
Speed: The tabletop movement rate�
Combat Skill: The value added to hand-
to-hand combat rolls� Note: Enemies do 
not add Combat Skill to archery attacks�
Toughness: You must roll equal to or over 
this value to inflict damage�
Resistance: This is added to rolls to 
resist spells�

THE ENEMY

Step 2: Champions
Each mob is checked to see if it is led by a 
champion when it is placed on the gaming 
table� This is usually an experienced 
fighter and can be represented by a more 
dangerous-looking figure or by a figure 
with a different weapon from the rest of 
the mob� If your orc mob has swords, you 
may want to use a figure with a mace as 
their champion, for example�
Roll 1D6 per mob, and if the roll is equal 
to or above the champion score listed in 
the Enemy Encounter table, one of the 
figures will be a champion�
Some units have two numbers listed� 
If the D6 result is equal to or above the 
higher number, the mob will have two 
champions�
Example:
If the champion roll says 4+ / 6+, 
a roll of 1-3 would indicate no 
champion, a 4-5 would indicate 
one champion, and a 6 would 
indicate two champions.
I roll a 4 for a mob of orcs which 
means they have one champion. 
Since my orc figures mostly have 
swords, I pick out a figure with a 
huge mace instead. 
Please note that champions are always 
part of the mob, not additional figures 
that are added to it� Champions receive all 
special abilities and benefits of the mob 
they are in�
Champions gain the following 
adjustments:
  Increase Combat Skill by +1
  Increase Resistance by +1 point
  Gain 6+ saving throw against all 
Hits� If the mob already has a saving 
throw, apply the rules for Multiple 
Saving Throws (see page 44) by 
lowering the saving throw by  
one point�
If the enemy type is one that obviously 
has no real intelligence, the champion is 
the biggest and meanest creature in the 
group� We use the term champion for 
simplicity� 
Sorcerer Champions
If the champion roll on the table is marked 
with a †, roll an additional D6 for each 
champion� A 6 indicates they are a sorcerer�
Sorcerers will cast Bleeding Curse every 
time they activate� This Hits the closest 
visible soldier on a 3+, regardless of Cover, 
and strikes with +0 damage� The Curse 
ignores all saving throws� 
Example 
Orc Champion
Move: 5"
Combat Skill: +1
Toughness: 3
Resistance: +1
War Rage
If Sorcerer 
Champion,  
+ Bleeding Curse 
(see boxout, left)

THE ENEMY
103
Step 3: Mob Size
Unless otherwise indicated, you will face  
3 enemy mobs at the start of the battle�
The campaign turn will inform how large 
enemy mobs are� This can be modified by 
certain game events� For simplicity every 
mob is the same size�
Step 4: Mob Training
All mobs are of a particular type, which 
determines their basic make up� The 
first two mobs deployed on the table are 
always warriors that lack any special 
abilities or modifiers� For any additional 
mobs set up at the start (usually one) and 
all mobs that arrive as reinforcements 
during a battle, roll D100 on the Mob 
Training table to determine their role�
You may track what mobs have which 
training on paper or by putting a small 
marker next to them, but a lot can also 
be done by carefully selecting the right 
miniatures� For example, if you need some 
orc assassins, maybe use an evil-looking 
cloaked figure as their champion�
Mob Training table
D100 Mob 
training
Notes
01-30 Warriors The standard enemy specimen.
No changes to the basic profile�
31-60 Archers Enemies with bows or crossbows.
The mob has ranged weapons and will attack using archery�
Enemies with a ‡ after their name on the Enemy Encounters 
table treat this result as Warriors� 
61-70 Runners Particularly fast enemies.
Add +1" to Speed�
71-80 Assassins Knives or fangs drip with poison. Stay clear.
The mob has poisoned weapons: When rolling for damage, an 
enemy with poisoned weapons rolls twice and uses the highest�
81-90 Heavies Thick hides or layers of armor.
The mob receives a 6+ saving throw (or adds +1 to an existing 
saving throw)�
91-00 Breakers Brute force and ignorance are surprisingly effective.
The mob has Large Weapons: +1 damage but does not inflict a 
Hit on a draw�
Mob Variation Roll (optional)
If you don’t mind extra dice, a D6 can be 
rolled for each mob when it deploys or 
arrives from the battlefield edge: 
D6 Variation
1 It arrives with one less figure.
2-5 It arrives with the expected size�
6 It arrives with one additional 
figure�

Step 5: Check for Villains
Have any villains been generated in 
your campaign so far? If not (or all have 
been killed), skip this step� Otherwise, 
roll 1D6 and add the number of villains 
currently listed on your campaign record� 
For example, if you have 2 villains in the 
campaign, you would roll 1D6+2�
  On a 5 or less, you will not encounter 
any villains in this battle� 
  On a 6 or 7, one villain shows up�
  On 8+, two villains show up� 
Pick randomly from the villains generated 
in your campaign� Note that villains can 
(and usually will) show up accompanying 
a different enemy type than the one 
they were created from� For example, a 
Hobgoblin villain may accompany a pack 
of evil wolves�
Step 6: Deploy Mobs
Measure 21" from your own battlefield 
edge and place a line of 6 markers 
distributed roughly evenly at that 
distance� If you have the option, use 
markers numbered 1 through 6�
Roll 1D6 for each mob and count left to 
right, placing each mob at the marker that 
is indicated, with all figures within 2" of 
the marker in a line or group as you prefer� 
If two mobs of the same type and training 
(such as orc warriors) are both placed at 
the same marker, they are merged into 
a single large mob� Mobs with different 
trainings (such as orc warriors and orc 
heavies) are not merged� Set them up 1" 
apart in two lines, Warriors in front, but 
otherwise arranged as you see fit�
If you are facing more than three mobs 
at the start, the first three begin the 
game Aware� Any additional mobs begin 
Unaware when deployed on their own� 
If required, randomly pick which mobs 
start Unaware� If a mob is merged into an 
existing mob upon deployment, the new 
combined mob will have the same state of 
awareness as the existing mob had� 
If present, each villain will set up within 
2" of a randomly selected mob� Villains 
are always Aware� Please note that the 
villain is not part of the mob and will 
move and fight independently� 
Example Orc Champion 
(Sorcerer) (Villain)
Move: 5"
Combat Skill: +1
Toughness: 3
Resistance: +1
War Rage
Sorceror: +Bleeding Curse (see page 102)
Villain: +1 ability (e�g� Warding Spells,  
see page 115); +2 Monster Points

Villains, Mobs, and Monsters
Villains are recurring characters created from 
a returning Champion (see page 115), and thus 
tied to Mobs� ‘Monsters’ (covered in the next 
section) are more solitary creatures, not usually 
integrated into a fighting force� As written, 
the rules wouldn’t see a whole forest of tree 
monsters attacking an orc stronghold, for 
example� (That would just be silly�) At the end of 
the day, however, this is your campaign!

MONSTERS
The giant twisted, groaning titanically, and fell back toward the far shore, 
hitting the water with a terrific splash and crushing a bunch of his buddies.
In the darkness and sudden quiet Brumm muttered, "Carl Gustaf don't care.”
– Forgotten Ruin
The worlds of Forgotten Ruin are full of 
gigantic, horrifying monsters that would 
love nothing more than to eat, stomp 
on, or maul your soldiers� Monsters can 
appear on the battlefield for a number of 
reasons, such as Aggression rolls�
To generate a monster, roll D100 on the 
Monster table opposite� 
If you are painting up figures for use in 
your campaign, you may prefer rolling up 
the first three monsters in advance so you 
can paint the figures� That way you can 
just take the next creature when the 
rules say you need one� As the various 
villagers and locals would no doubt tell 
you stories of the terrible beasts that 
lurk in the world, this is quite fair�
Repeat Encounters
If you generate a monster type you have 
previously battled in this campaign, it is a 
tougher and meaner version� Each repeat 
encounter increases the Monster Point 
value by +1� Note that this only applies 
between missions, not if multiple of a 
monster is encountered during a  
single mission�
Monster Difficulty
Some monsters are extremely scary, 
and you are unlikely to prevail against 
them� Evaluate carefully if you really 
need to fight a beast that shows up, 
or if it is better to focus on your 
Objectives or beat a 
hasty retreat�

Monster Traits
General Monster Traits
Remember, unless modified by other 
Monster traits below, all Monsters have 
the following general monster traits:
Dangerous: Monsters that roll a  
natural 6 on their combat die always 
inflict a Hit on the soldier even if they 
lose the combat� If the soldier’s combat 
roll is higher than the monster, they 
will still inflict a Hit on the monster and 
potentially stop it moving, as noted in 
Rampaging, below� 
Plodding: Monsters do not Dash� They 
only move at their basic movement speed�
Rampaging: Monsters cannot be stopped 
by just standing in the way� When a 
monster moves, it will fight hand-to-hand 
combat with each soldier it encounters� 
If a soldier wins, the monster halts, and 
damage is dealt normally� 
On a draw or a monster win, the soldier 
is pushed 1" out of the way as the monster 
finishes any movement� Note that the 
monster still takes a Hit on a draw� 
A soldier that has already been engaged in 
hand-to-hand combat during the monster 
move cannot be engaged again by the 
same monster that battle round (but the 
soldier could engage the monster on their 
own when they activate)� 
Sturdy: Monsters cannot be Knocked 
Down�
Specific Monster Traits
Aura: Soldiers who activate within 4" of 
the monster must roll 1D6+Toughness� 
Unless they score a 7+ they are unable 
to move or Dash but may take Actions 
normally�
Conjurations: Add +1 Aggression every 
battle round� This is cumulative for each 
monster with this trait�
Ethereal: The monster cannot have its 
MP reduced by more than 1 point per 
battle round, regardless of how many 
attacks hit it�
Fear: If the monster is facing towards a 
soldier within 12", the soldier is -1 to all 
hand-to-hand and ranged attack Hit 
rolls, regardless of the target� Monsters 
have a frontal 90-degree field of facing�
Fire: As a ranged attack, the monster 
places an Explosion centered over a 
random soldier in sight� Do not roll to 
Hit� Move the marker 1D6" in a random 
direction and then resolve as a normal 
Explosion attack with a 2" radius and  
+0 damage� 
Flight: When the monster moves, roll 1D6� 
On a 5-6, it will Swoop� It moves at double 
its movement distance in a straight line 
towards the nearest soldier (and past)� All 
soldiers in the path must roll 1D6+Wits� 
Those failing to score a 5+ are Knocked 
Down and take a +0 damage Hit�
A Swooping monster does not make any 
other attacks during the activation�

Humanoid: The monster does not use the 
Rampaging rule above� Instead, it moves 
and engages a single opponent in combat 
similar to a non-monster figure� 
Hurl: If a soldier is struck in hand-to-
hand combat but does not become a 
casualty, the monster throws them 1D6+1" 
in a random direction� The soldier is 
Knocked Down, as is any other figure 
they happen to land on� Soldiers can be 
thrown on top of terrain features�
Knit wounds: At the end of each battle 
round, the monster regains 1 Monster 
Point, though it cannot recover to more 
than 1 MP below the amount it began the 
battle with� 
Perplex: A soldier activating within 9" 
and sight of the monster must roll 4+ on 
1D6 to act normally� On a 1-3, they can 
move but cannot attack�
Poison: If the monster rolls a 6 in hand-
to-hand combat, roll 1D6: On a 6, the 
attack strikes a piece of equipment 
or pierces the target’s clothes� The 
soldier is pushed back 1", but not 
otherwise hurt or 
Stunned� On any 
other roll, they 
become a casualty 
regardless of 
Toughness or saving 
throws� Luck applies 
as normal�
Projectiles: If the 
monster does not 
attack in close combat, 
it may shoot at the 
closest visible target 
within 12"� Roll to 
hit as per a bow 
shot� The monster 
may attack up to 2 
additional soldiers 
that are within 1" 
of the initial target but may not attack the 
same target more than once per round�
Rend: Hand-to-hand strikes from the 
monster ignore saving throws except 
those that originate from magical armor� 
Swarm: The Swarm cannot be engaged 
in hand-to-hand combat and moves 
in a random direction each activation� 
Any figure from either side within 1" of 
the Swarm at the end of its move is Hit 
automatically (+0 damage)�
When attacking a Swarm, roll 1D6 for 
each Hit� On a 6, the Swarm is Weakened� 
If it was already Weakened, it is 
destroyed� Attacks have no other effect, 
and it cannot be affected by spells or 
magic items other than those that cause 
direct damage� The Swarm cannot be seen 
or moved through by either side� 
Tentacles: If the monster does not contact 
any soldiers during its move, it may lash 
out and fight hand-to-hand combat with 
the two nearest soldiers within 4"� 
When using its tentacles, the 
monster only counts as +1 
Combat Skill but does not 
take any damage if it is Hit� 
Undead: The monster 
counts as Undead for the 
purpose of all rules that 
have special effects 
against Undead�
Wizard: When 
activated, the 
wizard will move 
to cast their spell 
while keeping the 
opponents at range� 
They will always try 
to use Cover and  
will never enter 
hand-to-hand  
combat willingly�

ENDING THE BATTLE
To the east the sky was getting light, 
and I could hear great bests trampling off through the night, smashing trees 
and tearing them down as they fled for the river and the dark shadows of the wilderness 
beyond. Seeking caves and dark places they thought we would not go down into.
We'd won. For now.
– Forgotten Ruin
The battle can end in one of two ways:
Sudden Death Check
If, at the end of a battle round, you 
have just completed the last Objective 
(including any that were not required to be 
completed), roll 2D6 on the table below:
Sudden Death Check table
2D6 Outcome
2-4 The mission ends immediately as 
your soldiers slip away before the 
enemy arrives in huge numbers�
5-10 The mission continues for  
3 more battle rounds or until 
you have moved every soldier 
off a battlefield edge, whichever 
comes first�
11-12 As 5-10, but a bonus Objective 
is generated immediately� If you 
complete this within the next 
3 battle rounds, you receive an 
additional post-battle reward, 
and the mission then ends 
immediately� After 3 rounds, the 
battle still ends� 
This roll is done only once 
per mission, at the earliest 
opportunity when it applies, and 
cannot be delayed or avoided� 
Note that Investigations do 
not count as Objectives for the 
purposes of Sudden Death�
Abandoned Battle
In addition to the normal conditions, a 
game will end if, at the end of the battle 
round, there are none of your soldiers 
on the table� If this is the case, the game 
ends immediately, regardless of any other 
circumstances�
Note that while this typically occurs due 
to casualties, your squad can also move 
off the battlefield to end the encounter 
sooner� This can be helpful if you are 
facing opposition that is far too strong� 
Part of being an effective commander is 
understanding when it is worth fighting 
to the bitter end and when to cut your 
losses� Remember, the enemy will not 
stop coming, no matter how long you 
keep shooting�
This only applies to your soldiers� 
Clearing the table of enemies will not 
end the battle due to the Aggression 
mechanic, but you should take advantage 
of the time to secure your Objectives and 
get out of there�

Outcomes
When a battle ends, you will have won the 
mission if you completed the Objectives 
correctly� Otherwise, you did not win� No 
other factors – such as killing enemies 
not specified by an Objective or clearing 
Investigations – affect victory� 
Note that you will still receive rewards 
after a mission even if you did not win, 
though victory brings better rewards, 
of course� 
Make sure to set aside any soldiers that 
became casualties during the battle, as 
they may suffer from long term injuries� 
Soldiers that moved off the edge of the 
battlefield are not casualties, and will 
return to your squad just fine� 
Proceed to the Post Battle Sequence  
(page 114) to resolve the various outcomes� 
Better Part of Valor
Dying and completing this mission 
will prevent you from completing any 
missions tomorrow� In battle you must 
constantly balance risk and reward� 
Rangers go into battle expecting that 
any day could be their last, but as their 
commander you need to keep the grand 
plan in mind�
A battle may turn out to be easier than 
expected: Everything goes well, the fire 
support is right on target, and you breeze 
through the mission� Other days, you are 
barely holding on and then the dragon 
shows up� 
You could end a mission early by 
moving every soldier off the table, if it 
goes haywire�

POST-BATTLE SEQUENCE
After each battle you will carry out this 
post-battle sequence to determine the 
result of the mission� Proceed through 
each step in order� 
Step 1: Injuries
Soldiers that became casualties during 
your mission must test to see what the 
effects of the injuries were� A soldier 
that was taken out of action may have 
suffered only relatively minor injuries or 
they may have been seriously injured or 
even killed outright� 
We handle this slightly differently 
depending on whether they are a grunt or 
a known personality�
Grunts:
Take a number of D6s equal to the 
number of grunt casualties and roll them 
all at once: 
Every 1 results in one grunt being either 
killed or so badly injured that they 
cannot participate in the campaign  
any further�*
On 2-6, they recover and rejoin your 
squad just fine� 
*If you wish to know exactly what 
happened for flavor purposes, roll the die 
again: A 1-2 is dead, a 3-6 is a long term 
injury� These characters are removed 
from your squad and will not rejoin it�
Known Personalities:
Roll D100 on the table below, rolling 
separately for each soldier�
Known Personality Injury table
D100 Casualty Effect
01-15 Dead Pour one out for a 
fallen comrade�
16-35 Seriously 
injured
The soldier will 
have to sit out the 
next two battles 
before they rejoin 
your squad�
36-65 Lightly 
injured
The soldier will 
have to sit out the 
next battle before 
they rejoin your 
squad�
66-00 Okay The soldier was 
unconscious or got 
a few bruises� They 
recover fully before 
the next battle�
So... Who’s Got the Ring?
Regardless of whether they are a grunt 
or known personality, if a soldier is 
killed, roll 1D6 for each magic item they 
carried� On a roll of a 1, it was destroyed� 
Otherwise, you may transfer it to your 
equipment Stash (see page 123)�

Step 2: Check for Villain Creation
Did you “kill” any champions in the 
mission? If you did so and you achieved 
your Objectives, there is a chance some 
of the defeated champions will return to 
haunt you as a more powerful villain� If 
the mission was a failure, skip this step� 
Roll 1D6 for each champion you defeated: 
If any of the dice show a 6, that champion 
survived and becomes a villain� Note 
these down on your campaign roster� 
You may devise any explanation for how 
they survived, or roll 1D6 on the Survival 
Explanation table�
Survival Explanation table
D6 Result
1-2 Badly wounded and crawled 
away in the darkness
3 The creature you killed was 
actually a decoy
4-5 Their life was restored by  
dark magic
6 At the last minute they were 
teleported away 
Each villain should be named something 
suitably sinister� It is up to you if you want 
to use the same figure you used originally 
or paint up a special figure� 
Villains gain 2 Monster Points on their 
profile and a randomly selected ability 
from the Villain Ability table below:
Villain Ability table
D6 Ability Effect
1 Precise strikes Attacks by the villain ignore saving throws�
2 Hellfire spell The villain may shoot hellfire� This Hits on a 4+ regardless 
of Cover or Combat Skill, has unlimited range, and Hits with 
+2 damage�
3 Enchanted 
defences
The villain gains a 4+ saving throw�
4 Leadership Any mob within 6" of the villain becomes Fearless�
5 Warlord If the villain is present at the beginning of a battle, all mobs 
deployed initially will have one extra figure�
6 Warding spells Enemies within 8" of the villain gain a 6+ saving throw�
Step 3: Check for Villain 
Destruction
If you defeated a villain during the last 
mission, there is a chance they have been 
permanently brought down� Roll 1D6 for 
each villain you defeated: 
  On a 1, they escaped (you can use 
the flavor table in the previous step, 
if you like) and remain on your 
campaign roster� Increase their 
Monster Point score by +1 each time 
this happens�
  On 2-6, they have finally been 
defeated� You receive 1 Story Point�

---

## Page 118

RESOLUTION
116
Step 4: Check for Monster 
Destruction
Did you kill any monsters? If so, your 
exploits are sure to spread quickly 
throughout the lands.
  Monsters with 5 or fewer Monster 
Points grant you 1 Story Point when 
you kill them.
  Monsters with 6 or more Monster 
Points grant you 1 Story Point when 
they have lost half their Monster 
Points and 1 additional Story Point 
when you have destroyed them.
Story Points are only awarded based on 
the final score at the end of the battle. You 
cannot gain points multiple times from a 
monster that somehow regains some of its 
Monster Points. 
Step 5: Get to Know Your Squad
As the campaign progresses, you will 
become familiar with more of the soldiers 
that make up the squad. Think of this like 
a television show where each episode 
features a different character. 
Select a grunt in your squad. They 
become a known personality and 
immediately roll twice on the Character 
Traits table on page 20. This works 
exactly as when you create a new 
character at the start of the campaign.
If every squad member is known, you can 
instead note down the details of a soldier 
elsewhere in the platoon, in case you get 
to meet them later.

Step 6: Character Advancement
Any skilled commander understands the 
importance of having experienced, battle-
hardened troops at their disposal, and the 
best way to obtain that experience is in 
the heat of battle�
Select one known personality that fought 
in the battle� You can do this based on 
who you would like to improve, who did 
something particularly cool (or lucky!) in 
the battle, or anything else you like� 
Immediately roll D100 twice for them on 
the Advancement table below and choose 
the result you like best� If you roll the 
same advance twice, you must take it� If 
any result would advance a score beyond 
the maximum, make that roll again�
Advancement table
D100 Advancement
01-15 Increase Reactions by +1 
(maximum 5)�
16-30 Increase Speed by +1" 
(maximum 8")�
31-45 Increase Combat Skill by +1 
(maximum +3)�
46-60 Increase Toughness by +1 
(maximum 5)�
61-70 Increase Wits by +1 
(maximum +4)�
71-80 Gain 1 point of Luck 
(no maximum)�
81-00 Gain a new skill rolled on the 
Skills subtable on page 118� 
If you roll a skill you already 
have, either select any skill 
from the table or receive  
1 point of Luck (your choice)�
A given soldier may receive only two 
advancements over the course of the 
campaign� Soldiers carried over from 
a veterans roster can receive one 
advancement during the course of each 
campaign they play as veterans� 
Spell-caster Advancement
Spell-casters do not receive Advancements, 
but instead receives a new spell (rolled 
randomly on the Spell table, page 52)� 
Spell-casters cannot receive any other 
advancements or skills, though they may 
retain any they already had� 
If you roll a spell you already have, you 
may instead select any spell you like, but 
as the spell-caster is researching it, you 
do not receive it until after the following 
mission is completed�
Campaign Turn 1
Did you just complete the first turn of 
the campaign? Your main character (that 
you picked during Character Creation, 
see page 22) automatically gains one 
advancement in addition to the soldier 
you pick to receive one� Note that you 
cannot assign both advancements to the 
same character�
Learning How to Wizard
It is possible for a soldier to learn how to 
cast spells from a scroll, but it is much less 
likely than through Arcane Transformation 
(see page 133)� In the Post-battle Phase, 
you may attempt to learn from a scroll� 
Roll 1D6� On a 5-6, you learn the spell and 
are now a wizard� On any other roll, the 
spell is burned up and lost, and you made 
no progress� 
You can try as many times as you like, 
provided you have enough spells on 
scrolls�

16-30 Covering 
fire
The soldier has become an expert at quickly getting into 
position to fire.
The character may move a full move and fire a weapon with 
the Heavy trait, or Dash and fire a non-Heavy weapon� In both 
cases the attacks will Hit only on a natural 6�
31-45 Heads down The soldier has practiced their ability to fight effectively from 
even minimal cover.
When Hit by archery attacks, you receive a 4+ saving throw�
46-60 Parry The soldier has learned how to fight effectively in hand-to-
hand combat.
In hand-to-hand combat, you may reroll an enemy combat die 
once per phase�
61-70 Motivation The soldier has become a pillar of the squad, inspiring their 
comrades.
When the character activates, one other character within 6" 
and Line of Sight can remove 1 Stun token�
71-80 Redeploy The soldier has gained an increased level of tactical 
awareness.
If the character is assigned a Reaction result of 1, they may 
immediately swap places with another soldier within 6"� This 
occurs before either character activates� It does not matter 
when the other character would activate�
81-90 Rapid fire The soldier has practiced their ability to engage multiple 
targets rapidly.

is Possible?
In some rare cases you may have no 
known personalities that also fought in 
the battle you just completed or which 
are eligible to advance due to already 
having 2 advances� In this case, pick 
any personality you like� If you have 
no options at all, you must forego the 
advancement�

Step 7: Field Promotions
If your squad leader died, select a fire 
team leader in the squad to replace 
them� They receive the Leadership skill 
immediately� The fire team leader position 
is then filled by a regular soldier from the 
same fire team�
Squad leaders that are recovering from 
injuries are not replaced� Someone else 
takes their spot temporarily and is only 
in the role for a short while and therefore 
does not receive the Leadership ability�
If your platoon NCO or platoon leader 
dies, they are replaced� Roll 1D6: On a 
5-6, one of your soldiers is selected (any 
soldier that is not the squad leader can 
become platoon NCO, only your squad 
leader can become platoon leader)� 
These promoted characters retain any 
advancements and rewards they received 
while in your squad� If your squad leader 
is promoted, another soldier must be 
promoted into that slot� 
Step 8: Replacements
If you have vacancies in your squad due to 
injuries, the platoon might send you some 
new faces� Think of the rest of the platoon 
as a general group of people that exist 
beyond your immediate experience and 
from which replacements may be sent 
when required�
Tally up how many vacancies you have in 
the squad currently� There is a vacancy if a 
soldier has died or is currently recovering 
from injuries� If a you have a vacancy, you 
receive one replacement� 
If you have more than a single vacancy, 
roll 1D6 for each vacant spot beyond the 
first, with a replacement arriving on a 5-6�
It is very possible you will have to go 
into battle short of a full squad� It is also 
possible you end up with additional 
soldiers once some of them recover 
from their injuries� If you end up with 
more than nine soldiers at any point, 
you must send the excess back to the 
platoon� However, you should keep notes 
of those soldiers� Next time you receive 
replacements, you pick from any soldiers 
that were previously in your squad, if any 
are available� 
As you play, you may have soldiers in 
the platoon that have received items or 
rewards while fighting in your squad� If 
there are, you may always pick one of 
those soldiers as replacements� 
Example:
I am down three soldiers after the 
last mission: one is dead and two are 
injured and recovering. 
I get one replacement automatically 
and then roll 2D6. Rolling a 2 and a 
6, I get one more replacement. 
A New Outlook on Things
Promotions hopefully bring out the 
best in people� Roll on the Character 
Trait table (page 20) and then choose 
if you want to replace an existing 
trait with the new one�
Squad Sizes
A squad has 9 soldiers� If you are playing 
with a different type of unit than current-
day Americans, adjust this number to the 
correct squad or section size for that force�
Replacement Limits
The platoon only has so many soldiers to 
go around to maintain 3 squads� You can 
take a maximum of 12 replacements over 
the course of the campaign�

21-35 Elite enemies The enemy has dispatched some particularly tough mobs 
to take you out.
Next battle, a random warrior mob rolls twice on the 
Mob Training table (page 103) and receives both benefits� 
If you roll a duplicate, the second roll instead grants an 
additional champion figure� 
36-45 Time is of the

The enemy is closing in and you will need to make haste.
In your next battle, every round after Round 5 generates 
+1 Aggression�

Step 10: Gain Support Points
You always gain 1 Support Point 
automatically� If your platoon leader 
accompanied you on the mission and did 
not become a casualty, gain an additional 
Support Point�
Support Points accumulate until 
you spend them� Track them on your 
campaign roster�
Step 11: Exposure
The longer you spend in this world, 
the more you begin to be a part of 
it� As that progresses, your soldiers 
will start to experience changes and 
develop fantastical abilities� Exposure 
is tracked for your squad as a whole, 
with all Exposure Points earned going 
into a single pool tracked on your 
campaign roster� 
You automatically earn 
1 point of Exposure in 
any mission that lasts 
for 3 battle rounds or 
longer� Certain events in 
the campaign can also 
award additional points 
of Exposure� Regardless 
of the source, they are 
pooled into a single resource 
pool until you spend them�
See the Transformations 
chapter (page 132) for ways to 
spend your Exposure points� 
Step 12: Loot
The world is full of marvelous magical 
things, from enchanted swords to 
alchemical potions, and stranger objects 
yet� After each battle, you may roll once 
on the Loot tables (see page 122) to see 
what you found�
Magical items tend to be attuned to 
willpower and determination (not to 
mention being lucky)� If you succeeded 
in your mission, you roll twice and 
then choose which of the items you 
want to receive� 
Missions may occasionally generate a 
bonus Objective when rolling for 
Sudden Death� If it did and you 
completed the additional Objective,  
you receive both items rolled on the 
Loot table�
There are other possibilities to obtain 
Loot which are detailed in the rules as 
they occur�

Step 13: Gather Kit
You have only limited supplies available, 
but you just might be able to talk your 
way into some military goodies� Likewise, 
your soldiers will come across interesting 
things in monster lairs or bartered from 
villagers, and be able to kit-bash some 
much needed upgrades from scrap�
After every mission, you receive Kit Points 
and may spend them on any items you like 
from the Kit List table below� Kit Points 
can be saved up� 
Earning Kit Points
You receive 1D6 Kit Points every mission 
as long as the mission lasted for at least 
3 battle rounds� If you win, you may roll 
twice and pick the better score�
All items must be carried by a specific 
character to be usable� Characters can 
carry only one of a specific type of kit, but 
can carry multiple types�

Step 14: Sort Out Your Equipment
Once you know what your squad will look 
like for the next battle, you can rearrange 
your weapons and equipment� If you had 
casualties, their weapons remain available 
to you and can be reassigned� The primary 
weapons of your squad are the assault 
rifle, submachine gun, and shotgun� Each 
figure with one of these primary weapons 
allows you to take one soldier armed with 
a squad automatic, sharpshooter’s rifle, 
or grenade launcher�
One sharpshooter’s rifle can be 
swapped for a grenade launcher or the 
other way around�
One soldier with an assault rifle, sub-
machine gun, or shotgun can swap for 
another of those three options�
Magic items and mission gear can be 
stashed or issued to any soldiers you like� 
Items that are stashed can be retrieved 
after any future mission� 
Note that magical items can be alluring: 
If you want to transfer a magic item from 
a soldier who currently has it (whether 
to the Stash – see boxout, above – or 
to another soldier) and they are not 
currently recovering from injuries, roll 
1D6� On a 1, they refuse to do so, though 
you may try again after a future battle� 
Step 15: Update the Map
After fighting through a region, it can be 
marked as clear using any method you 
like, such as crossing it out or planting 
a flag on the map� Your actions have 
helped the people living here gather 
their strength and retake the region 
from the monsters� 
Step 16: Get Ready
You are now done with your campaign 
turn and ready to begin the next one!
Review the Campaign Flow (see page 67) 
to see what is happening next� If the turn 
you completed was before Turn 12, the 
next turn is waiting for you� Some players 
prefer to prepare the next mission in 
advance before they stop for the day, 
while others enjoy doing that as part of 
the next day of gaming�
If you just completed Turn 12, turn to 
Final Battles (page 94) to find out how it 
is all going to go down� 
The Stash
As you play, you may end up with items 
you don’t have a specific use for at that 
moment� These go in your Stash� The Stash 
is the pool of gear you have available, but 
which is kept at the base� At this point, any 
excess items can be left in the Stash, and 
stashed items can be retrieved for use� 
Items in the Stash cannot be used during a 
mission but are safe and cannot be lost�

LOOT
One end of the staff had been carved into the head of a dragon, its snout wide and toothy 
and malevolent, its carved eyes glittering with dark destruction. Even the wood itself 
was unsettling, its patterns and whorls seeming more like other places than mere 
textures in the grain. Worlds and hidden rooms if you looked close enough.
– Forgotten Ruin
When the rules say you have earned one 
or more Loot rolls, they are resolved using 
the tables in this chapter� Roll D100 for 
each Loot roll and check the tables to see 
what item you receive� All rolls lead to 
sub-tables that require an additional roll�
When you win a mission, you may roll 
twice and pick� Determine all details of 
each item before choosing�
Items are either Consumable or 
Permanent� Assume all items are 
Permanent unless described as 
Consumable� Consumable items do 
not have to be carried by a specific 
character and can be used at any time 
by any member of your squad� Using a 
Consumable item is a Free Action� 
Permanent items cannot be used until 
they have been assigned to a character� 
This is normally done during the 
campaign post-battle sequence� If you find 
an item during a battle, it can be issued 
immediately to any character within 2" 
of the point where it was found, and used 
right away� Otherwise, it is added to your 
campaign Stash� 
Permanent items may grant bonuses to 
specific functions, act as weapons, or give 
special abilities that can be activated� 
Each item will explain if it is used 
automatically, or requires a Free Action or 
a Combat Action to use�
A character can carry any number of 
Permanent items but cannot use more 
than one for any given action� For 
example, even if you have three magic 
swords you are lugging around, you will 
have to pick which one you use when 
you fight in a hand-to-hand combat, 
though you could switch swords between 
combats if desired�
Typically, you will do better if you share 
your items throughout the squad to 
maximize their benefits�
Specific Carry (realism option)
Players who struggle with the abstraction 
of unassigned items moving between 
figures may prefer that Consumable items 
are carried by specific soldiers and can 
only be used by that soldier�  
Form Factors Do Not Matter
Other than the general category of item, 
the exact form factor is not important 
to the game and a given magic item can 
take any form you like� This is particularly 
useful for players that want their 
miniatures to closely resemble their in-
game reality�

you to get into the fight.
The saving throw always matches the 
battle round number: 1+ in Round 1; 
2+ in Round 2; and so forth�
Armor of Movement
A particularly light suit of armor. It 
actually enhances your ability to move.

Ghost Form
A translucent drink, slightly minty.
The character cannot attack or be attacked 
except by spells� They cannot pick up 
items, but anything they currently carry 
can be kept� Ghost form characters 
can move through terrain features 
unhindered but cannot climb up on 
things, and will fall harmlessly to the

Healing
A rejuvenating elixir, tasting faintly like 
berries.
Can be given to a character after a battle 
to ignore one roll on the Injury table� 
This must be used before rolling on the 
Injury table�
Holy water
You are definitely not meant to drink this.
This can be thrown at an Undead 
mob within 6"� Roll 4D6, with each 
4-6 destroying one figure in the mob 
automatically� The figures closest to the 
thrower are Hit first� If thrown at an 
Undead monster, each 4+ inflicts  
1 Monster Point of damage� No saving 
throws apply.
If you find holy water from an 
“Unidentified” potion, you may keep it 
until you are ready to use it�
Leaping
A slimy draught with an acrid smell.
Instead of moving normally, the character 
can leap up to 6" in a straight line� They 
may leap up onto terrain features, down 
from features, or across gaps or figures�
Shrinking
It only has a slight taste.
The character becomes tiny� They can 
move at only half speed but cannot attack

for this and 2 more activations� 
Strength
A thick brew, bubbling disconcertingly.
For the rest of the mission, the character 
adds +1 to both Combat Skill and damage 
rolls in hand-to-hand combat only, and 
will Knock Down any non-monster foes 
they strike� They may move and fire with

Unidentified potion
This could be anything, really.
The effect is unknown though you 
can make some guesses� When drunk,

When I began to dream in Elvish, it was then I knew I could speak it.

First Platoon's sector on the east side of the island the Rangers were defending

Transformations allow your soldiers to 
truly become part of the fantasy world� 
Whether it is learning to cast spells or 
assuming a fantastical form, the result is 
sure to be spectacular� 
Transformations are earned with 
Exposure Points� These are earned as  
you take on missions as explained in the 
Post-Battle Sequence (see page 114), as 
well as from a range of other sources�  
At your discretion, it costs 3 or 4 Exposure 
Points to earn a Transformation (see 
below)� The Transformation always 
happens to a random soldier who does 
not already have one� 
Transformations will occasionally match 
up with the outlook and talent of a 
particular soldier: 
  If you paid 3 points, you roll once 
on the table below and receive the 
result of the roll� 
  If you paid 4 points, you roll twice 
and can pick either result� If you roll 
the same result twice, you must pick 
that one� 
No Spell-caster in the Squad?
If none of your soldiers can cast spells 
currently, you may opt to take The Arcane 
instead of rolling randomly� Please note 
that you cannot roll and then opt to pick 
The Arcane�

The character is blessed with arcane 
insight�
  Randomly select 3 spells that the 
character can use from now on�
  Future advancements for this 
character must be used to buy  
new spells�
Upgrades:
The Sight: [+1 Exposure] Add +2 to the 
Wits score of the character�
Spell Acquisition: [+3 Exposure]  
The character immediately learns any 
spell of your choice�
Apprentice: [+2 Exposure] One character 
with no Transformations becomes Arcane 
themselves and begins with 1 spell 
selected at random from those known by 
this character� 
The Miniatures Challenge
Of course, you will need a suitable 
miniature to use for the new soldier� 
This can be solved by using an 
appropriate figure from a fantasy 
role-playing game, but enterprising 
modelers can get a lot of fun out of 
kit-bashing minotaurs with rocket 
launchers and so forth� The entries 
are open-ended, so you can exercise 
as much creativity as possible in 
adapting cool miniatures�

The Centaur
The bad news about having a horse body 
is that you need two pairs of boots.
  The character increases their Speed 
by +2" when moving in a straight 
line and always adds +3" to their 
Dash moves.
  Another soldier can ride on their 
back and will move when the 
centaur moves. Shooting from 
horseback counts the shooter’s 
Combat Skill as +0. Mounting up 
or dismounting takes an action. If 
the centaur becomes a casualty, the 
rider is placed where they fell.
  In hand-to-hand combat, only the 
centaur fights, not any mounted 
soldier (your soldiers are not  
trained knights) but you may add 
any magical weapon bonus of  
either character (only one weapon 
can be picked).
Upgrades:
  Stomp: [+1 Exposure] If a hand-to-
hand combat by rider or centaur 
ends in a draw, the centaur can 
decide to Stomp. The soldiers are  
not Hit, and the target is Hit with 
+0 damage (regardless of any  
weapons used).
  Leap: [+2 Exposure] The soldier 
may replace a Dash move 
with a Leap of 1D6+1". 
The Leap must be in 
a straight line and 
can clear any figures 
or obstacles up to 
normal human 
height. A rider can 
be dropped off at any 
point of the Leap. 
The Cursed (Werewolf, 
Weretiger, Wereboar, etc.)
The character can shape-shift into a 
dangerous animal such as a tiger or wolf.
Shapeshifting takes an action and must 
be done after the battle has started. No 
die roll is required. The character cannot 
change back during the battle.
  While in animal form, the character 
cannot use any weapons but has 
natural melee weapons (teeth and 
claws) adding +1 to both the Combat 
Skill and damage rolls. They Hit 
twice versus any monster.
  The character can add their full 
movement when Dashing in animal 
form, instead of only moving +3".
  The character receives a 6+ saving 
throw against all attacks in both 
human and animal form.
Upgrades:
  Brutal attack: [+1 Exposure]  
In animal form, if the character  
rolls a natural 6 on the damage 
roll, the target does not receive any 
saving throws. 
  Regeneration: [+2 Exposure]  
The character cannot be 
Stunned, and rolls twice, 
picking the best result, when 
rolling for post-battle 
injuries. This benefit 
applies in human 
form too.

The Divine (Cleric, Paladin, etc.)
The character is suffused with divine 
energy�
  The character may negate any 
magical attack aimed at themselves 
or a soldier within 6" and Line of 
Sight on a D6 roll of a 4+� 
  Once per battle when another 
soldier within 6" would become 
a casualty, the Divine soldier may 
recite a chant or prayer, negating the 
Hit completely� Only one character 
can be protected in this fashion even 
if the attack struck multiple targets�
Upgrades:
  Inspire Awe: [+1 Exposure] When 
the character activates, select a mob 
within 6" and roll 3 Morale dice� 
The effect applies even if the mob 
would be Fearless or is otherwise 
unaffected by Morale tests, 
though champions remain 
immune as normal� 
  Divine Aura: 
[+2 Exposure] 
 The character and 
all allies within  
6" receive a  
6+ saving throw�
The Green (Elf, Halfling, 
Plant Person, etc.)
The character feels a new connection to 
the wild things�
  They do not suffer any terrain 
penalties due to forest or other 
natural features and ignore all 
darkness penalties�
  The character receives a bow and 
may shoot it in place of a military 
weapon� Unlike enemy bows, the 
character adds their Combat Skill to 
shots� They strike with +1 damage, 
ignores Cover, and a natural 6 to Hit 
will ignore saving throws�
Upgrades:
  Keen Archery: [+1 Exposure]  
When stationary, the character may 
shoot twice when using their bow or 
any magical ranged weapon� 
  Infiltration: [+2 Exposure]  
The character may choose to begin 
the game off the battlefield� They are 
assigned Initiative dice normally� 
When they are active, they may 
choose to remain off the table or to 
arrive� When they arrive randomly, 
select a soldier on the battlefield, 
then place the Infiltrator anywhere 
you like within 6" of them� The 
Infiltrator cannot move 
when they arrive, but 
may shoot (counting as 
stationary) or be placed 
directly into hand-to-hand 
combat� All shooting and hand-
to-hand combat rolls receive a 
+1 on the round they arrive�

The Minotaur
The character wakes up as a hulking  
half-bull beast�
  They can move and fire normally 
with weapons with the Heavy trait, 
and, if engaging in hand-to-hand 
combat during their activation, they 
may roll the combat dice twice and 
pick the best score�
  They increase their Toughness score 
by +1 (maximum 6)�
Upgrades:
  Hulk: [+2 Exposure] The character 
ignores the first Hit each battle 
that would make them become a 
casualty�
  Horns: [+1 Exposure] The character 
has a natural melee weapon that 
Hits for +1 damage� 
The Savage (Hyena-folk, etc.)
The character's bestial nature expresses 
itself in bestial features: claws, fangs, and 
bloodthirst�
  Increase Toughness by +1  
(maximum 6)�
  The character can enter hand-to-
hand combat with a Follow Up move 
and may fight immediately when 
doing so� This can occur only once 
per phase� 
  When fighting monsters in hand-
to-hand combat, a natural 6 on the 
damage roll allows another damage 
die to be rolled (and thus additional 
Monster Points to be lost)� This can 
trigger multiple times� 
Upgrades:
  War Cry: [+1 Exposure] Any mob 
that tests Morale for any reason 
within 8" of the soldier must add 
one additional die to the number 
rolled�
  Blood Instincts: [+2 Exposure] 
The soldier rolls two dice in 
hand-to-hand combat and 
picks the best of the dice� 
If both dice score a 6, an 
additional Hit is inflicted 
(for a total of 3 due to the 
Great Hit rule)�

Covered in heavy scales, with a thick, 
spiny, or finned tail�
  The Scaled get a 6+ saving throw 
against Hits and do not suffer any 
movement penalties in water or 
swamp features, including Swamp 
regional terrain�
  They can move at normal pace 
through Impassable water features 
though they cannot attack or be 
attacked while within a water 
feature�
Upgrades:
  Tail Slap: [+2 Exposure]  
After successfully striking a mob 
enemy in hand-to-hand combat, you 
may Knock Down both the target 
and another figure of the same mob 
within 1"�
  Cold-blooded: [+1 Exposure]  
The character does not suffer any 
penalties from being in Desert 
regional terrain� Additionally, they 
get +1 Reactions in Desert, Swamp, 
or Jungle regional terrain�
  Thick Scales: 
[+1 Exposure] 
The saving 
throw is 
improved 
to 5+ and 
ignores the 
Rend monster 
ability�
The Scoundrel (Thief, Bard, etc.)
The character has gained a strange 
combination of luck and foolishness�
The character cannot receive a saving 
throw due to armor or any other type of 
protection� Instead, whenever anything 
hostile strikes the character, such as 
an attack or spell, they may attempt to 
Dodge� Roll 1D6, with 5-6 avoiding the 
threat and allowing the character to 
move a single base move in any direction 
immediately� The Dodge roll is not a 
saving throw and cannot be negated by 
attacks that prevent saves, nor can it be 
modified up or down by any effect or rule� 
Dodging applies to all types of traps and 
natural hazards�  
Upgrades:
  Thieves’ Luck: [+1 Exposure] 
Whenever the character makes 
a Wits test of any kind, they may 
opt to reroll if they do not like the 
result� The Wits reroll has a fixed 
+1 modifier, regardless of what the 
actual score was� Other modifiers 
apply normally�
  Silent Movement: [+1 Exposure]  
If the character does not shoot when 
they activate, they are hidden and 
cannot be shot at or targeted by 
spells until the Scoundrel activates 
again� They can be attacked 
normally in hand-to-hand combat 
and can be targeted normally by 
enemy archers or spell-casters 
within 8"� Note that an enemy that 
is not within 8" will ignore the 
Scoundrel for all purposes� 
  Use Cover: [+1 Exposure]  
If the Scoundrel is in Cover, they 
can Dodge archery attacks on a  
4+ instead of the customary 5+�

The Skyborne (any Variety of 
Bird-person)
The character has a huge pair of wings 
allowing limited flight�
  They no longer take any falling 
damage, and can ignore obstacles, 
chasms, and terrain penalties when 
moving�
  They may add 3" to the range of any 
thrown hand grenades�
  If on a raised terrain feature, the 
character can glide instead of 
moving normally� The character 
lands on any lower position (or the 
ground) within a horizontal distance 
equal to double the height of their 
position� For example, if they are 3" 
above ground level, they could land 
anywhere within 6" (measured on 
the ground)�
Upgrades:
  Wing Buffet: [+1 Exposure]  
Any opponent that rolls a 1 on 
their hand-to-hand combat dice is 
Knocked Down� They take 1 Hit, in 
addition to any normal outcomes of 
the battle�
  Take to the Sky: [+2 Exposure] 
The character may fly into the sky 
by spending both their Move and 
their Action� On any subsequent 
activation, they can land anywhere 
on the table as a Move and take 
an action normally� The character 
cannot use any flying abilities at all 
for the next two battle rounds� 
The Swarm (Mantis-folk,  
Spider-folk, etc.)
A horror with a chitinous exo-skeleton

Toughness and use the worst result� 
This does not work against Undead�

damage and any magical abilities of 
one weapon only (but the character 
can choose each melee), and add a +1 
modifier when rolling for hand-to-
hand combat to account for the other

CAMPAIGN END
Outside it was dark now. The air was getting cold. And the island and the forest 
were dead silent. No drums. Not even the smell of smoke from out there in the woods. 
But you could feel something coming. Feel the length of the long night already 
stretching out into a never-seeing-the-sun-rise-again moment.
You could feel that they were coming now. Coming for us.
– Forgotten Ruin
Did you win the final battle? You 
emerge triumphantly as the evil keep 
collapses around you� Blood-soaked 
and battered, you have freed this world 
from a grave evil and can enjoy a few 
moments of quiet�
Did your squad all fall? Your heroic 
efforts have allowed the locals to mount 
an assault and drive the enemy out of 
their lands� Your wounded soldiers are 
rescued from the rubble and thanked 
profusely for their effects�
Either way, the survivors are able to 
recuperate, gather their thoughts, and 
make contact with the rest of the ranger 
force� Your adventure has come to an 
end… for now�
When you have played out the conclusion, 
the campaign has come to an end� Reflect 
on how you came out of it, how your 
favorite characters did, what your favorite 
moments were, and what it all felt like�
All unspent resources such as Story 
Points, Support Points, Kit Points, and so 
forth are lost�
All kit, weapons, and magic items are 
discarded, even if currently carried by a 
character� 
You now tally up your Victory Points to 
see how well you performed:
Outcome Victory Points
Every mission where 
you completed your 
Objectives
1 VP
Every villain defeated 1 VP
Every Special Mission 
completed
Additional 
+1 VP
Final Battle won Additional 
+2 VP
All awards are cumulative� 
Please note that the Artifact battles do not 
award any Victory Points, but the final 
battle does� 
If you achieve fewer than 5 Victory Points, 
the campaign has ended in defeat� You 
may save a single soldier of your choice to 
the veteran roster (see page 140)�
Victory Point Modifier
When determining your Victory Points at 
the end of the campaign, a multiplier is 
used� The multiplier starts at x1.0� Each 
point of Difficulty Factor changes it ±0.1 
up or down�
For example, if you earn 8 Victory Points 
and used a Difficulty Factor of +2, you 
would multiply by 1.2 for a final Victory 
Point score of 9.6�

RESOLUTION

In future campaigns you should strive to 
beat your prior best score, but as long as 
you end up with at least 5 Victory Points, 
you succeed� 
Story Point Bonus
Every 4 Victory Points you earned gives 
you one additional Story Point which 
may be listed on your veteran roster� 
These can be taken at any point in any 
future campaign� When each is used 
up, it is gone and will not be replaced, 
though there is no limit to how many 
you can earn over the course of playing 
multiple campaigns�
Final Advances
For every 6 Victory Points you earned, 
you receive one Final Advance� This can 
be taken as either an experience advance, 
or an upgrade for a Transformation 
(regardless of cost)� It can be applied to 
any soldier just like a regular 
advance, turning them into 
a known personality in the 
process, and allows you to get 
one of your grunts up to 
speed so they can be 
a more attractive 
option on your roster 
in a future campaign�
Create or Update Your 
Veteran Roster
If you won (5+ Victory Points achieved), 
you may save any of your soldiers to 
your veteran roster, a sheet of past 
soldiers you may choose to use in future 
campaigns (you may dedicate a spare 
platoon sheet to this purpose)� You are 
not required to save all of them if you 
only want to keep certain soldiers� For 
example, a grunt that never gained any 
advances may not be important to keep�
If you lost (fewer than 5 Victory Points), 
you may save just ONE soldier of your 
choice�
When you begin a new campaign, you 
may pick up to two soldiers from your 
veteran roster to carry over� 
When saving a character roster, include 
any Final Advances from this section, 
but do not save any kit, equipment, or 
magical items obtained� Such things must 
be earned again in the new campaign� 
In essence, what you are saving is the 
character profile and any skills and 
Transformations gained� Upgraded 
Transformations are saved 
in their upgraded form�

MY GAME DID SOMETHING 
STRANGE!
The game may throw some unexpected 
elements your way� If you are not sure 
how to proceed, this section provides a 
few pointers:
A game event may refer to something 
that is not possible, such as an increase 
in Aggression in a mission that does 
not use the Aggression rule� If so, any 
impossible parts of the effect are simply 
ignored� For example, the Loot result on 
the Investigation table causes 2 points of 
Aggression to be earned, which would be 
ignored in the first two campaign turns; 
however, you would still receive the Loot�
If a lot of things appear to be happening 
simultaneously and it is getting confusing, 
stand back and resolve things in the order 
in which they were initiated� If you work 
through things one at a time you will 
usually be able to make sense of it�
If two things appear to make each other 
impossible, whichever was initiated 
first should take precedent� If they are 
completely even, try to do your best� In 
most cases you can either let the events 
cancel out or you could roll randomly to 
pick which takes precedent�
Remember that events do not stack 
up� For example, one figure moving 
or attacking may make it possible (or 
impossible) for another figure to do 
something they were previously intending 
to do that round� For example, if a figure 
makes an attack that kills an opponent, 
another figure could now move through 
that space or select a different target�
Key 'rule of thumb’: In general, 
special cases supersede regular cases� 
If an item or ability modifies 
how a core rule works, the item 
or ability takes precedent�

MINIATURES
Selecting Miniatures
You will need two batches of miniatures 
to play the campaign: Military figures 
for the soldiers and fantasy figures for 
the bad guys� Luckily, both are readily 
available on the market� For military 
figures you can use figures from cold war 
and modern-day wargames ranges while 
any range of fantasy figures will do just 
fine� As figure ranges often fall out of 
availability and companies occasionally 
close up business, we have opted not to 
make specific recommendations here� 
Figures are usually described as being in 
a particular scale, such as 15mm or 28mm� 
This is the height of the figure, typically 
measured from the feet to the eye level� 
Note, however, that manufacturers often 
have some variation from each other and 
two figures that are both nominally 15mm 
may in fact not fit perfectly together, 
though on a gaming table the differences 
are usually not a big deal�
15mm figures are very popular for 
historical gaming and are quite cheap� 
They also do not take up a substantial 
amount of storage space and will allow 
your gaming table to feel quite large� 
28mm is the scale associated with many 
fantasy and science fiction miniatures 
games� These figures are often elaborate, 
and reward effort when painting them 
in detail�
Both will work well for your collection 
and will offer you a range of options� 
Even if you opt to use 3D printed figures 
instead of purchasing metal, resin, or 
plastic figures, they are usually indicated 
as being best for a particular scale� 
There are other scales, such as 6mm and 
10mm, though they are less common for 
skirmish gaming� 
Plastic figures for model builders are 
usually indicated as 1:72 scale, 1:35, or 
similar� These figures are quite cheap and 
can make good gaming figures, though 
finding fantasy creatures can be very 
difficult� Nominally, 1:72 figures should fit 
fairly well with 20mm metal figures� 
When buying monsters in particular, 
don’t neglect that a figure can often work 
out of scale� A small but mean lizard in 
28mm scale can be a fearsome monster 
on a 15mm battlefield, for example� 
Suitable gaming figures can often be 
found in unusual places: Toy stores often 
have containers full of plastic lizards, 
frogs, insects, and so on which make 
excellent monsters to fight� 
If physical miniatures are not your style, 
you can also find sets of print-and-play 
paper miniatures available for sale� Many 
of these are aimed at roleplaying gamers, 
so fantasy creatures are easy to find� Then 
you can simply print out as many as you 
need for a particular game� Other options 
include liberating some figures from an 
old board game� 
You will have to make some decisions in 
advance about how open-ended you want 
to be with your figures� Some players 
find that part of the fun of the game is 
painting up new miniatures for each 
encounter to match what they are fighting 
exactly, while others are happy to use 
the orcs from last game as hobgoblins 
this time and the skeletons can stand in 
for zombies� At the far end of the scale,

## Page 146

APPENDICES
144
the orcs might be skeletons now! Neither 
way is wrong, it all depends on what your 
time and budget allow and what you are 
looking to get out of the game�
Quite a few gamers use procedural games 
as a way to either get more figures in their 
collections painted (or to add more figures 
to their collections), which can be quite 
useful in its own right!
Picking Bases
Plastic figures usually come with bases, in 
which case you can just use those� Metal 
figures may have a cast on their bases, 
but typically you will want to attach them 
to a larger base to make the figure more 
stable, as well as easier to handle� 
Round bases are traditional for skirmish 
gaming and since you do not need to 
know exact facing of figures in the rules, 
they will work great here� The exact base 
size won’t matter, though 20-25mm across 
is common� In general, if your bases are 
reasonably similar in size, it won’t matter 
a lot if some are slightly larger or smaller� 
The thickness of the base is mostly a 
matter of personal tastes: A thicker base 
is easier to grab, and some people enjoy 
the feeling of the figure being more like 
a board game piece, while others prefer 
a thinner base that doesn’t draw as 
much attention�
Bases are made from a range of materials 
with plastic, acrylic, metal, and wood all 
being available� Again, these are mainly a 
question of personal taste� 
Converting Miniatures
It is almost certain you will run into 
a situation you do not have a suitable 
miniature for� Transformations tend to 
make this happen as your sniper suddenly 
sprouts wings� You may opt to not worry 
too much about this� After all, characters 
come and go and spending time 
meticulously converting a figure only for 
them to die in the next battle can be quite 
a punch to the gut�
If you enjoy tinkering with models, 
however, you may find the challenge to be 
quite exciting� And after all who wouldn’t 
want to own a minotaur holding an M249 
squad automatic weapon?
The process of modifying miniatures is 
called converting (or occasionally “kit 
bashing”)� Essentially, you use pieces of 
different miniatures to build what you are 
trying to achieve� This can mean swapping 
out the heads of two figures, replacing 
one weapon with another or even a more 
complex build using pieces from a range 
of figures� Long-term gamers tend to 
accumulate a substantial amount of spare 
parts and trinkets (lovingly referred to as 
a “bits box”) from old miniature kits you 
have assembled and occasionally random 
items you find around the house and 
might one day find a use for�
As many modern figure kits are made 
from plastic, conversion can be quite 
easy: The plastic can be cut or filed to fit 
and simple plastic glue (poly-cement) will 
bond the pieces together very strongly� 
When working with metal figures, it will 
tend to require a bit more work to cut 
things apart, and super glue is required�
When working with resin figures, be 
careful: Filing or cutting resin releases a 
lot of very unpleasant dust that you do not 
want to breathe in� Make sure to work in a 
ventilated room and wear facial protection�

Getting Started on Painting
Painting your miniatures is a big part 
of making the game come alive� It also 
creates a sense of achievement when you 
see your creations come to life� Painting 
can be daunting, but there is no need to 
worry: Getting started is very easy and 
you can improve your skills quickly� 
It is okay to decide in advance what 
standard of painting you want to reach 
and be comfortable with� If painting turns 
out to be something you love, then you 
have a potentially lifelong hobby in front 
of you� If you just want your figures to 
look acceptable on the table, you can rest 
assured that the techniques to achieve an 
okay figure done are easy to acquire�
A wealth of beginner's guides is 
available online� This section is only 
intended to get you started and to 
remove a bit of the mystique from the 
process� It is the method the author 
uses to get a lot of figures table-ready in 
as little time as possible:
Paints and Brushes
Always use acrylic paints when starting 
out� Craft store paints can be okay, 
but paints formulated specifically for 
miniatures painting will often have a 
wider range of colors so you don’t have 
to mix anything� It is a good idea to buy 
a starter set with different colors if one 
is available� Acrylic paints mix just fine, 
but if you use a particular color a lot, it 
can be frustrating to try and capture the 
same shade each time you have to mix a 
new batch� There’s no inherent reason to 
stick to a single manufacturer for paints, 
though once you are used to a particular 
consistency you may prefer it� If you are 
looking to rely on your local hobby store, 
look at what their main ranges are and 
pick one of those� 
Get a couple of brushes in different sizes� 
There is no need to buy expensive brushes 
when you are just starting out� A few basic 
synthetic hair brushes will be fine until 
you learn what you like to paint with� You 
will want both a slightly larger brush, a 
couple of fine but not too thin ones for 
general work, and a fine-detail one� 
Lastly, invest in a wet palette� This allows 
your paints to last much longer while you 
are working with them and will save you a 
lot of paint in the long run� 
Painting Steps
The first step is to prime your figure� 
This is also called base coating or 
undercoating� The best way to do this is to 
use special paint called “primer”, though if 
you can’t find any you can also use a thin 
layer of regular paint� The purpose of the 
primer is to help your paint job adhere 
better and resist damage more easily� 
Specially made primer paint helps “bite” a 
little, so the paint jobs will look good�
Priming is usually done in white or black� 
White can be easier to work with as it 
doesn’t obscure details, though it’s less 
forgiving of mistakes� Your colors will tend 
to look a bit brighter on a white undercoat� 
Black primer gives darker, deeper colors 
and works well for figures with metal or 
earth tones� As a compromise, the author 
often uses a pale grey�
Once your primer is dry, start painting 
in all the base colors you are intending 
to use for things like uniforms, weapons, 
exposed flesh, helmet, and so on� It is 
easiest to start from the lowest point of 
the figure and work your way out so that 
if you get a bit of paint on the raised areas 
you will paint them over later� While you 
paint, make sure to thin down your paints 
a little� It is better to go back over a piece 
a second time than to slather on a thick 
layer of paint that obscures the figure�

When all the pieces on the figure have 
been painted, it is time to do some dry 
brushing� This can work both to add 
highlights to raised parts of a figure, as 
well as do wonders on features such as fur 
or armor� This is best done with a separate 
brush as it can be rough on the bristles� 
Get a bit of paint on a brush and wipe it 
on a paper towel until it is almost all gone, 
then roughly brush over the area� The 
raised edges will pick up traces of paint� 
For armor, a black primer with metal dry 
brushed over it will look good� 
When you are happy, and things have 
dried completely, add a wash� Washes 
are a very thin but highly pigmented 
paint� When brushed on, the wash will 
pool in the recesses of the figure, adding 
definition� It is great for picking out details 
in things such as facial features or subtle 
parts of a weapon� You can make your 
own washes but when starting out it is 
recommended to just buy a couple of pots�
When you have a finished figure, make 
sure to treat the base� At the least you 
should paint it (green is traditional) but 
it will look nicer if you afterwards cover 
it in PVA glue and then sprinkle flock 
over it� Flock is a sort of fine sawdust-like 
material, usually colored green, available 
from any gaming supply store� Make sure 
to paint the base before doing this or the 
color of the base will shine through� You 
can add tiny pebbles, bits of static grass, 
or mix in different colors of flock to 
brighten your bases and the entire paint 
job, making the figure look really amazing 
– an easy way to jazz up a quick paint job�
There is a near-infinite number of 
painting techniques to get figures looking 
like little works of art� Once you have an 
idea what you are doing and what you are 
trying to achieve, there is a whole world of 
painting tips, techniques, and tutorials out 
there waiting for you�
Getting Started with Terrain
Terrain serves a mechanical purpose in 
presenting obstacles for movement and 
concealment from weapons fire� It also 
helps reinforce the story of the game 
world� If your game takes place among 
village houses and fenced in fields, it will 
feel completely different from a game set 
in the wilderness with forest features and 
wild terrain�
You can purchase a lot of ready-made 
terrain both made specifically for 
wargamers and for railroad modelers� 
There are also ample guides to build your 
own from cardboard, wood, Styrofoam, 
and more� Many gamers find that they 
enjoy the challenge of building terrain 
pieces as much as they do painting figures 
or playing the game!

To get started, an easy build project is 
to use foam board (or similar)� Cut out 
squares, then cut a jagged pattern from 
corner to corner of each square so you 
end up with two roughly triangle shaped 
pieces� Attach these edge-to-edge in an 
“L” shape to a base and they will make up 
the corners of a ruined building� You can 
combine pieces like this in any pattern 
you like to make an entire ruined city to 
battle over� 
It is a good idea to plan your terrain 
projects in advance so you get a nice 
variety of types but also so you can plan 
a cohesive look� For example, if you start 
out collecting mostly natural features, 
you will ensure a realistic looking table 
and will probably want to continue with 
this theme� However, you can slowly start 
developing other options, for example by 
adding a few farmhouses which can then 
be the springboard for a village theme, 
and so forth�
Don’t neglect that this is a fantasy 
setting� You can get all manner of 
cool crystals and rocks from home 
decoration stores� A great source is your 
local pet store: The fish tank section 
will often have collections of fantastic 
looking plastic rock formations that look 
quite alien� Even a few such 
pieces can enhance the feeling 
that this is a strange world not 
like our own� 
The keen-eyed terrain collector can 
often find all manner of unexpected 
terrain hiding in plain sight: From an 
unusual garden rock to a few leftover 
miniatures painted grey and used as 
statues; the only limiting factor is your 
imagination� Just make sure you have 
room to store all of it!
The Weasels Mantra
“Two okay painted armies on okay 
terrain will look great in aggregate”.
What this means is that you do not have 
to paint every figure to masterly levels 
or have photo-realistic gaming terrain� If 
all of the figures in the game are painted 
to a reasonable table standard with 
finished bases, and you have a table with 
terrain, even if it is quite average, the 
result will still be a very nice-looking 
game that you will feel good about and 
can take pride in�
It also serves as a reminder that you will 
get more bang for the buck, visually, to 
complete everything to a reasonable 
standard� Often, people make the mistake 
of spending a lot of effort on painting 
their figures but then using cardboard 
boxes and CD cases for terrain, or lovingly 
paint their figures while 
leaving them on paint-
stained black plastic bases, 
completely undermining 
the hard work�

OTHER WAYS OF PLAYING
Playing Cooperatively
There are two common ways for two 
players to play the game together at the 
same time�
The first is to simply split the squad 
between you� Each of you takes half the 
squad, and when any other soldiers are 
accompanying you into battle you can 
assign them as you see fit� 
During tabletop battles, each player 
oversees their own soldiers while you 
either agree on what to do during the 
campaign steps or assign particular 
steps to each player� This can work with 
more than two players, but the number 
of figures per player can start to get a 
little thin� A player with only two soldiers 
might be knocked out of the battle pretty 
quickly, for example� An option is to have 
a third player as the Officer� They make 
all the campaign decisions, command any 
platoon elements that join the squad, and 
hand out the initiative dice�
The second possibility is to let one player 
command the enemies� This does not 
modify how the enemies are generated or 
any basic deployment restrictions such 
as enemies being Unaware� The “enemy 
player” will simply control the enemy 
figures when they would normally be able 
to act, and is free to move and fight within 
the normal rules� An enemy player can 
activate their forces in any order they like 
but enemies cannot take any actions they 
would not normally be able to perform 
under any circumstances� For example, 
the enemy cannot pick up a machine gun 
and start using it!
Players should be aware that facing an 
opposing player is likely to be more 
difficult than facing the game system 
normally� As such, you can award  
one additional Story Point for every three 
battles you play� If you want more variety, 
have the players alternate their roles, so 
in even numbered missions player A is the 
squad and player B is the enemy, and vice 
versa in uneven numbered missions� 
Of course, these options can all be 
combined for a cool multiplayer 
adventure with an enemy player and two 
squad players, allowing a whole gaming 
group to experience the game together�
Shared Campaigns
You may opt to play a shared campaign, 
meaning two or more players are all 
contributing to the same overarching 
narrative� This type of campaign can even 
be played online� You do not have to be in 
the same physical location to play�
This can be done in a number of ways� 
At the simplest, your squads are just 
part of the same platoon, undertaking 
missions alongside each other� You can 
add your Victory Points together or you 
can compete� This works best if you use 
the same map and fight the same enemies 
each time, allowing you to share your 
experiences after each battle� 
As an additional fun option, when a 
temporary soldier shows up in your 
squad, ask your friend to provide you with 
someone� You can even trade items and 
soldiers with each other� For example, you 
might offer a few extra Kit Points to your 
friend to help them out� 

---

## Page 151

APPENDICES

If you have three players, you will make 
up the entirety of the platoon, and 
there are no other soldiers available� 
This can be particularly challenging 
if a squad comes out of a fight with 
severe casualties and can make for 
a very tense club game, especially as 
you get to the end of the campaign and 
manpower is tight� 
In a shared campaign, you will have 
to maintain a rough schedule so that 
you are progressing through the 
campaign turns at the same pace� It is 
beneficial to have one player handle 
the administrative details, keep 
everyone on pace, and facilitate any 
transfers and communications� 
It is recommended to keep a central 
point of communication such 
as an internet chat server or 
message board, so everyone 
can report on their games 
and talk� 
Custom Scenarios
The setting of Forgotten Ruin lends 
itself extremely well to creating your 
own adventures, whether it is to add a 
special challenge to your campaign, or 
whether you are creating a scenario for 
another player� A fun way to play is to 
have one player act as the Game Master 
(GM) while one or more players then 
control the soldiers and fight against 
monsters controlled by the GM� In this 
case, the role of the GM is not to win 
a competitive battle but to create a 
entertaining and memorable experience 
for everyone involved�
Such scenarios can include unusual 
combinations of enemies, modified or 
custom enemies created specifically for 
the scenario, or scary new monsters� The 
scenario will also typically involve special 
Objectives to achieve� Such a special 
scenario could be played as part of a 
campaign, but can also be played as  
a stand-alone experience� The GM  
might instruct the players to pick  
2 Transformations and assign 2 advances, 
and then make them face the terrors 
of the Pit of Infinite Despair� If you are 
running a scenario for multiple players 
with their own campaign, you might even 
let each of them bring a couple soldiers 
from their own games�
A group could even create an entire 
custom campaign where every scenario is 
a special or unique one�
When preparing scenarios, try to keep 
things to 2 or 3 special conditions� If there 
are too many special cases to remember, 
it both becomes difficult to play the 
game and can also make the players feel 
like they cannot rely on anything� If you

are just starting out, don’t worry about 
keeping a scenario fairly basic: Start 
with a typical battle scenario 
and then tweak a couple of 
things to get an interesting 
outcome�
Example:
You set your 
scenario inside a 
ruined temple. As 
a special hazard, 
anyone firing a 
machine gun or 
using explosives 
risks of causing 
parts of the temple 
to collapse. The first 
time this happens, 
you place rubble 
around the table 
to block Lines 
of Sight but, 
the second time, 
the soldiers might be flattened by 
the collapsing ceiling. The goal of 
the scenario is to locate a hidden 
treasure and once a soldier does 
so, they get a cool magic wand you 
have invented. However, two ogres 
that are living in the temple will also 
show up and try to eat the soldiers.
You don’t have to invent brand new things 
every time� You can get a lot of mileage 
out of taking an existing creature and 
renaming it, or tweaking one of its profile 
numbers by a point up or down�
A classic trick from fiction is to have 
a recurring evil character that is 
encountered multiple times� They can be 
loaded up with cool special abilities and 
attacks, with their powers evolving a bit 
each time they show up� Consider a range 
of options here such as curses, paralyzing 
or teleporting characters, and so on, 
instead of just being loaded up with 
ultra-powerful killing spells�
If you are the GM, be careful not to do 
overdo it on a favorite villain� While it 
can be a lot of fun, the game is ultimately 
about the soldiers, and you should not 
overshadow them� There is a fine balance 
between a recurring enemy and an 
insufferable one� 
Unique scenarios can also present a great 
way of introducing unique rewards such 
as new magical items, transformations, or 
skills� Be careful with adding things that 
are too powerful: It is easy for the game to 
enter a power spiral where increasingly 
dangerous monsters are introduced to 
contend with ever more destructive spells 
and items� If in doubt, limited or single-
use items are a good solution: A very 
powerful magical item that is only usable

once can get you out of a sticky situation, 
but it won’t stick around to cause 
potential problems down the line�
Even if you are playing on your own, 
you can still create unique scenarios to 
fit into your campaign� You can use the 
existing campaign rules as a guideline� 
For example, you might create a 
Special Mission inside a volcano� Since 
this is more dangerous than normal, 
you might then increase the mission 
rewards slightly� 
If this all seems intimidating, start out 
very small: Think about the story you are 
trying to have happen and then make a 
single game change to accommodate that 
story� For example, you have some cool 
dark elf crossbow figures, so you say that 
they must stand still to shoot but if they 
roll a 6 to Hit they score 2 Hits� 
Creating scenarios does not have to be 
a big, difficult process, and it can be 
immensely rewarding in getting a game 
experience that is uniquely yours� 
The Active GM
Game Masters can normally be described 
as active or passive� A passive GM sets up 
the scenario as explained above and then 
just runs the game, but does not generally 
make any decisions during the battle� 
If you wrote into the scenario that the 
villain has an escape route, then they do, 
otherwise they must fight it out according 
to the rules�
An active GM tends the game similar to 
how the GM in a roleplaying game does: 
This might mean creating things on the 
fly to make the game more interesting or 
to respond to the actions of the players� 
As with special rules in the scenario, limit 
this to make it more interesting and to 
avoid players feeling frustrated that they 
do not know what to expect� 
The best way to use active GM-ing is 
to make the world feel more alive by 
allowing the players to do things not 
normally possible in a miniatures game� 
For example, someone may want to 
set something on fire to smoke out the 
enemies holed up in a cave� As the GM, 
you can judge whether that plan ought to 
work and what is required for it to do so� 
If the plan has a chance of failure, have 
them roll 1D6 and try to get equal to or 
above a target number� Wits scores can 
be used as a modifier in most cases�
You can make a task have multiple 
steps (such as having to retrieve 
something first) or requirements (only a 
specific character has the correct tools), 
but it is best to keep it to two or three at 
the very most�
Players should have clear expectations 
of what is going on: If an action has no 
chance of working (you can’t set a fire 
because the villain bound a bunch of air 
elementals to the stone pillars), don’t have 
them roll to do so� Just inform them that 
it doesn’t work and let them figure out a 
different plan� 
Likewise, be aware of basic probabilities: 
If an action requires more than one 
die roll to succeed, the odds are much 
lower than you might expect� An action 
requiring three successful rolls becomes 
very unlikely to work� To do the math 
quickly, multiply the odds by each other�
If the first action succeeds 3 out of 6 
times, the odds are 50% (3 ÷ 6)�
If the second action succeeds 4 out of 
6 times, the odds drop to 33% for both 
actions succeeding (3 ÷ 6 times 4 ÷ 6)� 
As the GM, it is up to you if you want to 
adjust the difficulty of a scenario while 
it is going on� Personally, I prefers not 
to� After all, there will be another battle 
soon enough, and you can always make

that a little more difficult� If you want to 
interfere, try to do so in a limited fashion 
that feels believable� If the players are 
wiping out the opposition early on, 
have one more mob of elite enemies 
show up from a deep forest on the map� 
Conversely, if the players are having a 
hard time of it, let them know that the 
platoon will lob a few mortar shells their 
way, but they only get one go of it�
A good solution is to tie the event 
to something else to make it more 
interesting� A villain breaking off an 
attack to leave is not really believable, but 
the villain trying to make it to the center 
of the table where the players suddenly 
see a magical, glowing light means they 
now have a distracted villain, but also a 
choice to make� Advantages can be tied to 
this as well: For example, the bonus fire 
support comes, but someone needs to get 
on high ground to set off the flare� 
It can help to prepare a few of these 
options in advance� For example, when 
setting up the scenario, you might have 
both an easier and a tougher option in 
mind that you can implement, if you feel 
the situation of the table warrants it�
You can also prepare things to just 
spice things up� If the players do not go 
anywhere near a particular 
building, maybe a war party 
of gnomes with crossbows pops 
out and starts shooting at anyone in 
range, or a creature picks up the magic 
crystal you used to mark one of the 
Objectives and wanders off with it� 
Virtual Tabletops
For the forward-thinking gamer, virtual 
tabletops are always an option� Most of 
these programs are aimed at RPG players 
but can be used by miniatures gamers as 
well� You will have to find assets that are 
usable for your characters, enemies, and 
the various terrain options, though a lot 
of players have done much of the hard 
work for you�
Once it is all set up, it basically lets you 
play a miniatures game within a virtual 
3D environment, making it a perfect 
option for players who are limited in their 
available space or when you cannot have 
a full table set up� Since you are going to 
be engaging in a fantasy environment, 
there are a number of assets created for 
roleplaying games which you can take 
advantage of�

CREATING AARS
AAR is a military term that stands for 
After Action Report� It is used to describe 
a report on a battle that just concluded, 
and is often used by wargamers to 
tell stories about their exploits on the 
tabletop� Miniatures gamers tend to call 
them Battle Reports�
One of the most enjoyable ways to play 
solo games is the Social Solo where you 
play the game on your own but then share 
the results online� This can occur on social 
media, chat servers, or forums� 
An AAR can be as detailed as you like� 
Some players prefer capturing every 
event and die roll, while others prefer to 
keep things “big picture” and just capture 
the key moments� Many enjoy writing it 
out into an actual story that retells the 
events or add a few bits of fiction text to 
illustrate a particularly fun moment�
As many figure painters enjoy showing 
their progress on a particular project, 
planning and painting your enemies 
also makes for good, sharable moments, 
and it is a good way to get feedback on 
interesting miniatures you may not be 
aware of�
Photos of your gaming set up are 
generally included and most miniatures 
gamers love seeing photos of lovingly 
built gaming tables and figures (especially 
since it is a good excuse to go look for 
new figures for your own games)� This is 
also outstanding motivation to do more 
painting or to improve on those figures 
you rushed to the battlefield!
Battle Round 2:
I moved PFC Jamison and Sergeant Henderson over to the ruins in  
 
 order to get into a position where they could fire on the orcs as they  
 
 approached.
There were a lot of orc miniatures behind the rubble, but I was
 
 hoping the Squad Automatic Weapon would bother them enough
 
 that we could mop up the survivors pretty easily. 
Jamison did not have a target this round but the Sergeant had
 
Line of Sight to one of the enemies on the far side, so I had him take 
a shot but it came up a 1, so no cigar. 
 “You getting anything, Sarge?”
  “Not a damn thing – the smaller orcs are pretty slippery.  
 
   Keep your eyes peeled. When the first horned helmet
 
   emerges from behind those rocks, I want 10 rounds of 5.56
 
  right in its stupid face”
 “You got it, Sarge”.

ADAPTATION NOTES
Adapting any premise from one 
medium to another (in this case from 
novel to adventure wargame) always 
requires some careful thought about 
how to proceed�
One of the earliest decisions was to let the 
player create their own squad with their 
own personalities� If you have a favorite 
from the book, you may be surprised 
how often the dice conspire to give you 
a character that fits your favorite, but a 
big part of adventure wargaming is to 
establish a personal connection to troops 
and characters that are uniquely yours�
For a miniatures game, a challenge from 
the first novel is that the rangers spent 
a lot of time defending in place� That 
works to create very tense and exciting 
scenes in a novel, but on the tabletop, it 
would end up feeling repetitive� Instead, 
the player undertakes an array of 
missions that brings them into contact 
with the enemy� 
From these two decisions arose the idea of 
having the player’s force separated from 
the rest of the rangers and trying to fight 
their way back� This also cuts down on a 
little bit of the hardware and high-tech 
gadgetry which tends to be more fun 
in literature than in gameplay, such as 
drones and Claymore mines� 
This also explains why you may end up 
seeing completely different creatures to 
those the heroes encountered in the book� 
The novel takes place in a modest amount 
of real estate, so it would make sense that 
they only encounter certain creatures� 
When you finally meet up, your rangers 
will have quite a story to tell!
Within the realm of the Forgotten Ruin 
novels (and fantasy literature in general), 
a vast array of creatures and spells are 
possible� Since our perspective in a 
miniatures game is tactical combat, some 
cuts had to be made while other creatures 
and spells were added� 


---

## Page 157

Similarly, the choices of creatures, 
enemies, and transformations had 
to fit the dual requirement that 
people will want to use favorite 
miniatures in their game and that 
the option should be possible to 
represent at all� The result is that I 
have used broad types that should 
be easier to make line up with a 
given figure collection�
One of the core feelings of the 
novel is the contrast between high-
powered military firepower and the 
legions of orcs and other monsters� 
Of course, we could not ask players 
to paint up hundreds of enemies for 
the game, so things needed to be scaled 
down� In turn, as your rangers do not have 
direct access to the Forge from the book, 
they are assumed to be rationing their 
ammunition and supplies, which limits 
the amount of ultra-firepower you can 
put out in a  given engagement� The M249 
machine gun is capable for a rate of fire 
exceeding 800 rounds per minute, which 
sounds great until you realize you only 
have 900 rounds left�
Similarly, while pitting armored vehicles 
against giant monsters is attractive in 
theory, such vehicles present issues of 
balance as well as tiresomely demanding 
fuel be tracked in addition to ammo� 
If you have such models to hand, you 
might opt to place the vehicle model 
on the table to serve as terrain, having 
exhausted its ammunition and fuel in an 
earlier engagement�
It was important to capture the military 
feel in different ways, however, and the 
combination of Leadership Tactics and 
heavy weapons should do so nicely� 
Being able to pull off a critical tactic 
at just the right moment is endlessly 
satisfying, particularly if you can pull off 
an unlikely win in the process�

DESIGNER NOTES
Getting a chance to write something 
you never would have thought of can be 
extremely rewarding� Forgotten Ruin is 
such a wild concept that it simultaneously 
feels both very fresh and so obvious for a 
miniatures game: High firepower versus 
the evil hordes of a fantasy world� Part 
of why it works so well for wargamers 
is the transgressive effect of combining 
miniatures that normally aren’t used 
together� Seeing a fire team of US Rangers 
face down a mob of axe wielding orcs is 
just plain fun!
Mechanically, I knew the game would use 
the core mechanics from the Five Parsecs 
/ Five Leagues games� In the end I opted 
to stick fairly close to Five Parsecs from 
Home due to the firepower-oriented game 
play� Additionally, since we were going to 
have quite a few figures on the table, I was 
cautious about how much detail would be 
too much for players to handle� 
If you are new to these mechanics, you 
should find them approachable� Pay 
particular attention to the turn sequence� 
Who moves now and who moves later 
can often have a big impact on how your 
turns play out� Experienced ‘5X’ players 
will find that this game is not completely 
symmetrical; for example, we don’t track 
Stun markers for the enemies� The Knock 
Down status is also new, allowing a bit 
more of a cinematic vibe to the game 
as combatants get thrown around or 
knocked off their feet� 
The armory is comparatively small in 
Forgotten Ruin: , but the weapons are 
generally more powerful than what 
you are used to� It is a fool's errand to 
accurately model the fire superiority of 
a modern military rifle compared to a 
bow and the game does not really attempt 
to do so� The military weapons do have 
individual niches, and successful combat 
against the hobgoblins will require 
using each weapon to its advantage� 
Concentrated firepower will win 
battles, but you must deal with two 
other concerns:
First, the enemy will not relent� The 
Aggression mechanic means that more 
reinforcements are incoming, and they 
may well be quite unpleasant� Second, 
you are here to accomplish a mission� 
Whereas in the other campaign games 
in the series you are looking at the 
longer picture, in Forgotten Ruin you 
are a soldier first and foremost� While 
the missions may involve wizards and 
dragons, they are still missions� 


---

## Page 159

APPENDICES
157
I decided to focus on the procedural 
generation for missions rather than 
creating distinct scenarios� Setting up 
a mission can be somewhat dice-heavy 
but some of the steps are optional� The 
end result should be a very wide variety 
of possible tasks and, as unexpected 
components interact with each other, 
the challenge should be fun and 
unpredictable� Of course, at some level 
any wargame mission comes down 
to “shoot the other guys”, but there is 
potentially more going on if you want to 
be successful�
The campaign follows the familiar 
structure of pre-game, battle, and 
post-game segments� The emphasis has 
shifted a little towards the battle: The 
fights are both larger (a typical encounter 
might be 9 soldiers vs 15 or so enemies) 
and there is more going on in general� A 
battle can easily escalate out of control 
when a dragon shows up� Conversely, 
the player also receives some pretty cool 
tools to play with: The combination of 
Leadership Tactics, character traits and 
knacks, transformations, spells, magic 
items, and old-fashioned firepower can 
be quite potent, and the successful player 
will combine them in interesting and 
unexpected ways�
Advancement comes in multiple 
forms� Due to the large squad size, we 
opted not to rely on experience points 
for Forgotten Ruin: The Adventure 
Wargame� This also means that the 
level of advancement will be pretty 
uniform across a campaign� In return, 
the player gets to pick who receives 
the advancement, which you can use to 
beef up a strong character or reward 
someone who had a lucky shot in the 
last fight� Transformations open up a 
whole range of opportunities for players 
to really get creative�
In this game, campaigns have a set 
duration� When you have gone through 
the last turn, you are faced with the end 
game� This feeds back into every other 
part of the game: You only have a set 
number of advances, resources, and 
transformations to obtain, and because 
your soldiers are not impervious, putting 
all your upgrades into a single soldier can 
be high-risk if they then die� Tactically 
minded players may look at the time 
frames involved and plan ahead� 
In any solo game there is a temptation to 
try to “solve” the game – any game system 
has optimal solutions and superior 
options� Some players enjoy figuring this 
out, while others prefer prioritizing the 
story and only picking the options that 
feels like they fit the best� As thousands of 
people play a game, they will inevitably 
find elements that are exploitable to 
give players an edge� While some of the 
more obvious cases can be closed off by 
the designer, if you need to game a game 
system, you don’t need to hunt down all 
of them: You are the person with a pencil 
and the character roster, so if you prefer 
to give everyone a Combat Skill of +7 that 
is all up to you! 
One important final factor that is 
perhaps easy to miss is the presence 
of character traits� This is a little more 
open-ended than people may be used 
to in a miniatures game, but is a neat 
mechanic to add flair to a tense encounter� 
As written, the mechanic comes into 
play when a 1-point difference to the roll 
would make a difference� This is a fitting 
level for something like this� 
I hope you enjoy this game and that you 
have as much fun playing it as we had 
creating it�
Peace and love�
Ivan Sørensen�

The battlefield has never looked like this!
A time of danger, a secret mission, mysterious tech, and now you and your 
platoon of rangers are in a strange world inhabited by orcs, sorcerers, and dragons!
Forgotten Ruin: The Adventure Wargame takes you to the strangest 
battlefield yet, pitting state-of-the-art firepower against fantastical monsters. 
Just hope the orc horde runs out before the ammunition does!
Based on the Forgotten Ruin book series, the rules are powered by the ‘Five X’ game system 
from Five Leagues from the Borderlands and Five Parsecs from Home, unleashing the 
same solo adventuring thrills. Command your squad while the game rules control your 
enemies as they move and fight. You can even play with a friend by splitting your squad into 
two fire teams or designating one of you to control the enemy like a Game Master.
This adventure wargame offers an exciting mix of tabletop tactics for miniature figures and 
randomly generated campaign play, providing a unique, story-rich experience.
Inside this book you will find:
  Full rules for miniatures combat on 
strange battlefields including powerful 
heavy weapons, leadership tactics to 
customise your squad, spells, and  
off-map fire support.
  Stats for an array of foes to fight:  
20 enemy forces with 6 different types 
(such as Assassins or Archers) as well 
as 20 huge monsters to challenge your 
firepower.
  Rules to turn enemy champions into 
recurring villains.
  Campaign rules, objectives, and 
rewards, including magical treasures, 
advancements, and, best of all...
  Transformations! Ever wanted to be 
a centaur with a machine gun? An elf 
sniper? Or just a squad leader with 
a spell book? Your soldiers will not 
remain the way they were and the 
changes can be quite unpredictable!
