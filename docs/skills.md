# Skills

Forgotten Ruin MUD uses a skill-based progression system. Instead of traditional levels, your squad members will improve their skills by using them.

## Primary Skills

Each squad member has a primary role (Automatic Rifleman, Grenadier, etc.). Their primary skills are related to this role. For example, the Automatic Rifleman will improve his skill with machine guns the more he uses them.

## Secondary Duties

You can assign secondary duties to your squad members. These are skills that are not part of their primary role, but can be very useful for the squad.

The available secondary duties are:

*   **Medic:** Responsible for treating injuries.
*   **Engineer:** Responsible for repairing equipment and building fortifications.
*   **Talker:** Responsible for linguistic challenges and negotiations.

The more a squad member performs these duties, the more their skill will improve.
