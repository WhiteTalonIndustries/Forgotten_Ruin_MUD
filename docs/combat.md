# Combat

The combat in Forgotten Ruin MUD is a hybrid of modern ranged combat and traditional fantasy melee and magic.

## Ranged Combat

Your squad is armed with modern firearms, giving you a significant advantage over many of the creatures you will encounter. You will need to manage your ammunition and use cover to be effective.

## Melee Combat

When the enemy closes the distance, you will need to engage in melee combat. While not your primary strength, your Rangers are still formidable in a close-quarters fight.

## Magic

You will encounter enemies that can use magic. Your modern technology may or may not be effective against it. You will need to adapt your tactics to overcome these magical threats.
