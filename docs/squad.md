# Squad Management

In Forgotten Ruin MUD, you control a 9-person Ranger squad. The squad is your primary means of interacting with the world and surviving the dangers of Ruin.

## Squad Composition

Your squad is composed of:

*   **Squad Leader (You):** You issue commands to the rest of the squad.
*   **Alpha Team:** A 4-person fire team.
*   **Bravo Team:** A 4-person fire team.

Each fire team has a Team Leader, an Automatic Rifleman, a Grenadier, and a Rifleman.

## Issuing Commands

You can issue commands to your squad members to have them perform actions. For example, you can order a fire team to move to a specific location, or have a single squad member fire at an enemy.

More detailed commands will be available as the game develops.
