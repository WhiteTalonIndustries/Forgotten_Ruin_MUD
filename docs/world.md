# The World of Ruin

The world you have found yourself in is Earth, but not the Earth you know. A nano-plague collapsed modern civilization 10,000 years ago. In the ashes of the old world, a new one has arisen.

## Magic and Mutation

The nano-plague not only destroyed technology, but it also made magic a reality and mutated the surviving human population into various fantasy races. Orcs, trolls, and other creatures of myth are now real, and they are not friendly.

## The Dark Army

A vast army of these creatures, known as the Dark Army, is your primary enemy. They are led by powerful and intelligent beings, and they are bent on the destruction of all that is good in the world.

## Survival

You are outnumbered and outgunned (in a sense). You will need to use your wits, your training, and your squad to survive in this hostile new world.
